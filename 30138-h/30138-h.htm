<h2>I</h2>
<h3>THE NEW VESSEL OF WITHROW&rsquo;S</h3>
</div>
<p>It was only a few days before this that the
new vessel of Mr. Withrow&rsquo;s, built by him,
as everybody supposed, for Maurice Blake, had
been towed around from Essex, and I remember
how Maurice stood on the dock that afternoon
and looked her over.</p>
<p>There was not a bolt or a plank or a seam in
her whole hull, not a square inch inside or out, that
he had not been over half a dozen times while
she was on the stocks; but now he had to look her
over again, and as he looked his eyes took on a
shine. She had been designed by a man famous
the world over, and was intended to beat anything
that ever sailed past Eastern Point.</p>
<p>She certainly was a great-looking model of a
vessel, and &ldquo;If she only sails and handles half so
well as she looks, she&rsquo;ll do for me,&rdquo; said Maurice.
&ldquo;Yes, sir, and if she&rsquo;s up to what I think she ought
to be, I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to bet my share of what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
we make out South that she&rsquo;ll hold her own with
anything out of Gloucester&ndash;&ndash;give her a few weeks
to loosen up, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a good deal to say, for it was a great
fleet of vessels sailing out of Gloucester; but even
so, even allowing for a young skipper&rsquo;s pride in
his first crack vessel, it meant a whole lot coming
like that from Maurice Blake.</p>
<p>And on top of all that Maurice and Withrow
had to quarrel, though what about I never found
out. I only know that I was ready to believe that
Withrow was to blame, for I liked Maurice and
did not like Withrow, even though Withrow was
the man from whom I drew my pay every week.
And yet I could not understand it, for Maurice
Blake had been far and away the most successful
skipper sailing for Withrow, and Withrow always
had a good eye for the dollar.</p>
<p>No more came of it until this particular morning,
some days after Maurice and Withrow had
quarrelled. Wesley Marrs and Tommie Clancy,
two men that I never tired of listening to, were on
the dock and sizing up the new vessel. Wesley
Marrs was himself a great fisherman, and master
at this time of the wonderful Lucy Foster.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>When she swings the main boom over</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And she feels the wind abaft,</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></p>
<p>The way she&rsquo;ll walk to Gloucester&rsquo;ll</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Make a steamer look a raft.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>For she&rsquo;s the Lucy Foster,</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a seiner out of Gloucester,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
</div></div>
<p>was the way the fishermen of the port used to sing
about the Lucy; while Tommie Clancy was Maurice
Blake&rsquo;s closest friend.</p>
<p>With ballast stored, masts stepped, rigging set
up, and sails bent, setting as sweet as could be to
her lines and the lumpers beginning to get her
ready for the mackerel season, the Fred Withrow
was certainly a picture.</p>
<p>After a couple of extra long pulls, blowing the
smoke into the air, and another look above and
below, &ldquo;That one&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;ll sail some or I don&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; said Wesley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sure will,&rdquo; said Tommie; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a
jeesly shame Maurice isn&rsquo;t to have her.&rdquo; Then
turning to me, &ldquo;What in the devil&rsquo;s name ails that
man you work for, Joey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor nobody else knows. I&rsquo;d like to work
in that store for him for about ten minutes. I
think I&rsquo;d make him say something in that ten
minutes that would give me a good excuse for
heaving him out the window. He had an argument
with Maurice, Wesley, and Maurice don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
know what it was half about, but he knows he
came near to punching Withrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Wesley and Tommie had to talk that out;
and between the pair of them, thinking of what
they said, I thought I ought to walk back to the
store with barely a civil look for my employer,
who didn&rsquo;t like that at all, for he generally wanted
to hand out the black looks himself.</p>
<p>Then the girls&ndash;&ndash;my cousin Nellie and her particular
chum, Alice Foster&ndash;&ndash;came in to weigh
themselves, and also to remind me, they said, that
I was to take them over to Essex the next day for
the launching of the new vessel for the Duncan
firm, which had been designed by a friend of
Nell&rsquo;s, a young fellow named Will Somers, who
was just beginning to get a name in Gloucester for
fast and able models of vessels. Withrow, who
was not over-liberal with his holidays, said I might
go&ndash;&ndash;mostly, I suspect, because Alice Foster had
said she would not make the trip without Nell,
and Nell would not go unless I went too.</p>
<p>Then Nell and Miss Foster went on with the
business of weighing themselves. That was in
line with the latest fad. It was always something
or other, and physical culture was in the air at
this time with every other girl in Gloucester, so
far as I could see&ndash;&ndash;either Indian-club swinging
or dumb-bell drilling, long walks, and things of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
that kind, and telling how much better they felt
after it. My cousin Nell, who went in for anything
that anybody ever told her about, was trying
to reduce her weight. According to some
perfect-form charts, or something or other on
printed sheets, she weighed seven pounds more
than she should for her height. I thought she was
about the right weight myself, and told her so,
but she said no&ndash;&ndash;she was positively fat. &ldquo;Look
at Alice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s just the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Alice&ndash;&ndash;Miss Foster I always called
her myself&ndash;&ndash;and certainly she was a lovely girl,
though perhaps a little too conscious of it. She
was one of the few that weren&rsquo;t going in for anything
that I could see. She wasn&rsquo;t even weighing
herself, or at least she didn&rsquo;t until Mr. Withrow,
with his company manners in fine working order,
asked her if she wouldn&rsquo;t allow him to weigh her.</p>
<p>There were people in town who said it was
not for nothing that Alice Foster was so chummy
with my cousin Nell. They meant, of course, that
being chummy with Nell, who came down regularly
to see me, gave herself a good excuse to come
along and so have a word with Withrow. Fred
Withrow himself was a big, well-built, handsome
man&ndash;&ndash;an unusually good-looking man, I&rsquo;d call
him&ndash;&ndash;and a great heart-breaker, according to report&ndash;&ndash;some
of it his own. And he was wealthy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
too. I did not know, but somehow or other I did
not believe it, or maybe it was that I hoped rather
than believed that Miss Foster did not care particularly
for him; for I did not like him myself,
although I worked for him and was taking his
money. Being day in and day out with him in
the store, you see I saw him pretty much as he
really was, and I hated to think of a fine girl&ndash;&ndash;for
with all her cool ways I knew Miss Foster was
that&ndash;&ndash;marrying him. Just how Withrow thought
he stood with Miss Foster I did not know&ndash;&ndash;he
was a pretty close-mouthed man when he wanted
to be. Miss Foster herself was that reserved kind
of a girl that you cannot always place. She struck
me as being a girl that would die before she would
confess a weakness or a troublesome feeling. And
yet, without knowing how it came there, there was
always a notion in the back of my head that made
me half-believe that she did not come to the store
with my cousin out of pure companionship. There
was something besides&ndash;&ndash;and what could it be but
Withrow?</p>
<p>After the weighing was done Nell asked me all
at once, &ldquo;I hear, Joe, that Captain Hollis is going
to have your new vessel? How is that? We&ndash;&ndash;I
thought that Captain Blake was going master
of her&ndash;&ndash;and such a pretty vessel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered that I didn&rsquo;t know how it was, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
looked over at my employer, as much as to say,
&ldquo;Maybe he can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think now that I must have been a pretty
impudent lad, letting my employer know what I
thought of him as I did in those days. I think,
too, he had a pretty shrewd notion of what I
thought of himself and Maurice Blake. At any
rate, after the girls had gone, he worked himself
into a fine bit of temper, and I talked back at him,
and the end of it was that he discharged me&ndash;&ndash;or
1 quit&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m not sure which. I do know that it
was rapid-fire talk while it lasted.</p>
<p>It was some satisfaction to me to tell Withrow
just about what I did think of him before I went.
He didn&rsquo;t quite throw me out of the door, although
he was big enough for that; but he looked
as if he wanted to. And maybe he would have,
too, or tried it, only I said, &ldquo;Mind I don&rsquo;t give
you what Tommie Clancy threatened to give you
once,&rdquo; and his nerve went flat. I couldn&rsquo;t have
handled him as Clancy had any more than I could
have hove a barrel of salt mackerel over my head,
which was what the strong fishermen of the port
were doing about that time to prove their strength;
but the bluff went, and I couldn&rsquo;t help throwing out
my chest as I went out the door and thinking that
I was getting to be a great judge of human nature.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>A LITTLE JOG ALONG THE DOCKS</h3>
</div>
<p>I was sorry to lose my job. I was twenty years
old, without a trade or special knowledge of
any kind, and beyond the outfitting of fishing vessels,
knowing nothing of any business, and with
no more than a high school education&ndash;&ndash;and that
two years behind me&ndash;&ndash;and I knew of no place in
Gloucester where I could begin all over and right
away get as much pay as I had left behind me. I
might go to Boston, of course, and try for something
there&ndash;&ndash;I was not ten minutes out of Withrow&rsquo;s
before I thought of doing that. But a little
further thought and I knew there were more capable
men than I walking the streets of Boston looking
for work. However, a lot could happen
before I would have to worry, and so I decided
to take the air and think it over.</p>
<p>I might go fishing certainly&ndash;&ndash;I had had a little
experience in my school vacations&ndash;&ndash;if my mother
would only stand for it. As to that I did not
know. If it came to fishing or starving&ndash;&ndash;one or
the other&ndash;&ndash;then of course she would have to let
me go fishing. But my father had been lost on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
Grand Banks with his vessel and all hands&ndash;&ndash;and
then one brother was already fishing. So I hardly
thought she would allow me, and anyway I knew
she would never have a good night&rsquo;s rest while I
was out.</p>
<p>However, I kept thinking it over. To get away
by myself I took a ride over to Essex. There I
knew I would find half a dozen vessels on the
stocks, and there they were&ndash;&ndash;the latest vessel for
the Duncan firm and three more for other firms. I
knew one of the ship-carpenters in Elwell&rsquo;s yard,
Levi Woodbury, and he was telling me about some
of the vessels that had been launched lately. &ldquo;Of
course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you saw the one launched a few
days ago from here&ndash;&ndash;that one built for Mr. Withrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I had, and that she was a wonder to look
at and that I wished Maurice Blake, and not Sam
Hollis, was to have her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Levi, &ldquo;and a pity. Maurice Blake
could have sailed her right, though for that matter
Sam Hollis is a clever hand to sail a vessel, too.
And she ought to sail some, that vessel. But look
here at this one for the Duncans and to be launched
to-morrow. Designed by Will Somers&ndash;&ndash;know
him? Yes? A nice young fellow. Ain&rsquo;t she
able-looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She certainly was, and handsome, and Levi went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
on to tell me about her. He showed me where she
was like and where she differed from the Lucy Foster,
the Fred Withrow, the Nannie O, the Colleen
Bawn, and the others which were then causing trouble
in Gloucester with crews fighting over their good
qualities. I did not know a whole lot about vessels,
but having been born in Gloucester and having
soaked in the atmosphere all my life and loving
vessels besides, I had a lot of notions about them.
And I liked this last Duncan vessel. By the wind
and in a sea-way, it struck me she would be a wonder.
There was something more than just the fine
lines of her. There is that about vessels. You
can take two vessels, model them alike, rig them
alike, handle them alike, and still one will sail
rings around the other. And why is it? I&rsquo;ve
heard a hundred fishermen at different times say
that and then ask, Why is it? This one was awfully
sharp forward, too sharp some might have
said, with little more forefoot than most of the
late-built flyers; but she was deep and had a quarter
that I knew would stand up under her sail. I
liked the after-part of her. Racing machines are
all right for a few months or a year or two and
in smooth water, but give me a vessel that can
stand up under sail. I thought I could see where,
if they gave her sail enough, especially aft, and a
skipper that would drive her, she might do great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
things. And certainly she ought to be a comfort
in a blow and bring a fellow home&ndash;&ndash;and there&rsquo;s
a whole lot in that&ndash;&ndash;being in a vessel that you
feel will bring you home again.</p>
<p>I looked over the others, but none of them held
me like the Duncan vessel, and I soon came back
to Gloucester and took a walk along the waterfront.</p>
<p>It was well into March at this time&ndash;&ndash;the third
week in March, I remember&ndash;&ndash;and there was a
great business doing along the docks. The salt
bankers were almost ready to leave&ndash;&ndash;twenty-eight
or thirty sail fitting out for the Grand Banks. And
then there were the seiners&ndash;&ndash;the mackerel catchers&ndash;&ndash;seventy
or eighty sail of them making ready for
the Southern cruise. All that meant that things
would be humming for a while. So I took a walk
along the docks to see it.</p>
<p>Most of the vessels that had been fishing during
the winter had been stripped of their winter sails,
and now aboard these they were bending on the
summer suits and slinging up what top spars had
not already been sent up. For the vessels that
had been laid up all winter and stripped of everything,
they were getting out the gear from the
lofts. Everywhere it was topmasts being sent up,
sails being dragged out, stays swayed taut, halyards
and sheets rove&ndash;&ndash;an overhauling generally.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
On the railways&ndash;&ndash;Burnham&rsquo;s, Parkhurst&rsquo;s, and
Tarr&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;were vessels having their bottoms
scrubbed and painted and their topsides lined out.
And they all looked so handsome and smelt so fine
with their riggings being tarred, not with the
smoky tar that people ashore put on house-roofs,
but the fine rich-smelling tar that goes into vessels&rsquo;
rigging; and there was the black and dark sea-green
paint for the sides, with the gold or yellow
or sometimes red stripe to mark the run, and main
and quarter rails being varnished.</p>
<p>And the seine-boats! If there is anything afloat
that sets more easily on the water than a seine-boat
I never saw it, unless it might be a birch-bark
canoe&ndash;&ndash;and who&rsquo;d want to be caught out in a blow
in a canoe? The seine-boats all looked as natural
as so many sea-gulls&ndash;&ndash;thirty-six or thirty-eight feet
long, green or blue bottoms to just above the waterline
so that it would show, and above that all clear
white except for the blue or red or yellow or green
decorations that some skippers liked. And the
seines that went with them were coming in wagons
from the net and twine factory, tanned brown or
tarred black and all ready to be hauled on to the
vessels&rsquo; decks or stowed in the holds below, until
the fleet should be in among the mackerel to the
south&rsquo;ard&ndash;&ndash;off Hatteras or Cape May or somewhere
down that way.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>To feel all that and the rest of it&ndash;&ndash;to walk to
the tops of your shoes in pine chips in the spar
yards, to measure the lengths of booms and gaffs
for yourself if you weren&rsquo;t sure who were going to
spread the big mainsails, to go up in the sail-lofts
and see the sailmakers, bench after bench of them,
making their needles and the long waxed threads
fly through the canvas that it seemed a pity wasn&rsquo;t
to stay so white forever&ndash;&ndash;to see them spread the
canvas out along the chalk lines on the varnished
floor, fixing leach and luff ropes to them and putting
the leather-bound cringles in, and putting
them in too so they&rsquo;d stay, for by and by men&rsquo;s
lives would depend on the way they hung on&ndash;&ndash;all
that, railways, sail-lofts, vessels, boats, docks alive
with men jumping to their work&ndash;&ndash;skippers, crews,
carpenters, riggers, lumpers, all thinking, talking,
and, I suppose, dreaming of the season&rsquo;s work
ahead&ndash;&ndash;m-m&ndash;&ndash;there was life for a man! Who&rsquo;d
want to work in a store after that?</p>
<p>I stopped at Duncan&rsquo;s wharf and looked at
Wesley Marrs&rsquo;s vessel, the Lucy Foster, and then
the Colleen Bawn.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>And O&rsquo;Donnell drove the Colleen like a ghost through all that gale,</p>
<p>And around &rsquo;twas roaring mountains and above &rsquo;twas blinding hail,</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>and so on. And the Nannie O, another vessel that
fishermen sang songs about.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, the lovely Nannie O,</p>
<p>The able Nannie O,</p>
<p>The Nannie O a-drivin&rsquo; through the gale.</p>
</div></div>
<p>They were lying there, tied to the docks. They
were all dreams, so long and clean, with the beautiful
sheer fore and aft, and the overhang of the
racers they were meant to be&ndash;&ndash;the gold run, with
the grain of the varnished oak rails shining above
the night-black of their topsides, and varnished
spars. They had the look of vessels that could
sail&ndash;&ndash;and they could, and live out a gale&ndash;&ndash;nothing
like them afloat I&rsquo;d heard people say that ought
to know.</p>
<p>I walked along another stretch and at Withrow&rsquo;s
dock I saw again the new one that had been
built for Maurice Blake but given to Sam Hollis,
who was a boon companion of Withrow&rsquo;s ashore,
as I may have said already. Hollis&rsquo;s gang were
bragging even now that she&rsquo;d trim anything that
ever sailed&ndash;&ndash;the Lucy Foster, the Nannie O, the
Colleen Bawn, and all the rest of them. And
there were some old sharks, too, upon the docks
who said they didn&rsquo;t know but she looked as if she
could. But a lot of other people didn&rsquo;t think it&ndash;&ndash;she
was all right as a vessel, but Sam Hollis wasn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
a Wesley Marrs, nor a Tom O&rsquo;Donnell, nor a
Tommie Ohlsen, nor even a Maurice Blake, who
was a much younger man and a less experienced
fisherman than any of the others.</p>
<p>All that, with the vessels anchored in the stream
and the little dories running up and down and in and
out&ndash;&ndash;it all brought back again the trips I&rsquo;d made
with my father, clear back to the time when I was
a little boy, so small that in heavy weather he
wouldn&rsquo;t trust me to go forward or aft myself, but
would carry me in his arms himself&ndash;&ndash;it all made
me so long for the sea that my head went round
and I found myself staggering like a drunken man
as I tried to walk away from it.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>MINNIE ARKELL</h3>
</div>
<p>There was nothing for it. For a thousand
dollars a month I could not stay ashore.
Somebody or other would give me a chance to go
seining, some good skipper I knew; and if none of
the killers would give me a chance, then I&rsquo;d try
some old pod of a skipper. My mother would just
have to let me go. It was only summer fishing
after all&ndash;&ndash;seining wasn&rsquo;t like winter trawling&ndash;&ndash;and
in the end she would see it as I did.</p>
<p>I walked along, and as the last man in my mind
was Maurice Blake, of course he was the first I
had to run into. He was not looking well; I mean
he was not looking as he should have looked.
There was a reckless manner about him that no
more belonged to him than a regularly quiet manner
belonged to his friend Tommie Clancy. And
I guessed why&ndash;&ndash;he had been drinking. I had
heard it already. Generally when a man starts to
drink for the first time everybody talks about it.
I was surprised, and I wished he hadn&rsquo;t. But we
are always finding out new things about men. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
my heart I was not blaming Maurice so much maybe
as I should. I&rsquo;d always been taught that drinking
in excess was an awful habit, but some otherwise
fine men I knew drank at times, and I wasn&rsquo;t
going to blame Maurice till I knew more about it.</p>
<p>And we can forgive a lot, too, in those we like.
Maurice had no family to think of, and it must
have been a blow to him not to get so fine a vessel
as the Fred Withrow after he had been promised
and had set his heart on it. And then to see her
go to a man like Sam Hollis! and with the prospect
of not getting another until a man like Withrow
felt like saying you could. Everybody in Gloucester
seemed to know that Withrow was doing all he
could to keep Maurice from getting a vessel, and
as the owners had banded together just before this
for protection, as they called it, &ldquo;against outside
interference,&rdquo; and as Withrow was one of the
largest owners and a man of influence beyond his
vessel holdings, he was quite a power at this time.</p>
<p>Maurice Blake was far from being drunk, however,
when I met him this day. Indeed, I do not
believe that in his most reckless hour up to this
time he had ever lost control of himself so far as
not to know pretty nearly what he was doing all
the time; but certainly he had been drinking this
day, and the drinking manner did not set well on
him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>Maurice was standing on the front steps of
Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s boarding-house when I saw him. It
was Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s granddaughter Minnie that
married the wealthy Mr. Miner&ndash;&ndash;a rather loud
sort of man, who had been reported as saying that
he would give her a good time and show her life.
He may have given her a good time&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t
know&ndash;&ndash;but he was dead in two years. He was
supposed to be very rich&ndash;&ndash;three or four millions&ndash;&ndash;but
on settling up there was less than half a million.
Of course that wasn&rsquo;t bad&ndash;&ndash;enough for
Minnie to buy a big house next her grandmother&rsquo;s
for a summer home, and enough to go off travelling
whenever she pleased.</p>
<p>When she came back to Gloucester she was still
a very handsome girl, spoken of as the &ldquo;Miner
widow&rdquo; among people who had known her only
since her marriage, but still called Minnie Arkell
by most of those who had known her when she
was a child. In Gloucester she bought the first
house just around the corner from her grandmother&rsquo;s.
A handy passage between their two
back yards allowed her to visit her grandmother
whenever she pleased. She wanted to be near her
own people, she said, and was more in her grandmother&rsquo;s
house than her own.</p>
<p>Maurice came down the steps of Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s
boarding-house as I came along, and joined me on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
the sidewalk. He asked me the first thing if I
wouldn&rsquo;t have a drink, and I said no.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t drink.
Have a cigar,&rdquo; and he pulled one out of his pocket,
and I took and lit it. Generally I smoked a pipe,
but I liked good cigars, though I couldn&rsquo;t afford
them myself. This was not a good one&ndash;&ndash;more
like the kind they hand out in bar-rooms when
men get tired of drinking and say they guess they&rsquo;ll
have a smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it happen, Joe, you&rsquo;re not at the
store? I always thought Withrow held his men
pretty close to hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so he does, but I&rsquo;m not working for him
now.&rdquo; And then I told him that I had had an
argument with Withrow, been discharged, and
was thinking of going fishing. I didn&rsquo;t tell him at
first how it all came about, but I think he guessed
it, for all at once, after a searching look, he
reached out and shook hands with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I get a vessel again, Joe, and you still
want to go fishing and care for a chance with me,
you can have it&ndash;&ndash;if you can&rsquo;t go with a better man,
I mean. I&rsquo;ll take you and be glad to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That meant a good berth, of course, for Maurice
was a killer.</p>
<p>I looked at Maurice when he wasn&rsquo;t watching
me, and felt sorry for him. He was a man that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
anybody would like the looks of. It wasn&rsquo;t that
he was a handsome man&ndash;&ndash;I never could get to like
pretty men myself&ndash;&ndash;but there was something about
him that made you feel you could trust him. The
heavy tan of his face and the grip of his jaw
would spoil almost anybody for a beauty man, I
suppose, but he had fine eyes and his mouth was
all right, and he had a head that you&rsquo;d like to
stand off one side and look at, with hair that
seemed to lift and wave with every breath of
wind, and when he smiled you felt somehow that
he&rsquo;d saved that particular smile for you. He was
no better built than a hundred other men I knew
who were going fishing, and he was no bigger than
a thousand others sailing out of Gloucester, and
not near so big as a lot of others&ndash;&ndash;five feet ten
or eleven, maybe, he was, with level shoulders, and
very light on his feet&ndash;&ndash;but looking at him you
knew he was all there.</p>
<p>After smoking a while and watching him between
puffs, it flashed on me all at once that I was
pretty thick. A word or two my cousin Nell had
let slip&ndash;&ndash;not so much what she said as the way she
said it&ndash;&ndash;gave me a hint of a whole lot of things.
Looking at Maurice now I asked him if he had
seen my cousin or Miss Foster lately.</p>
<p>He flushed up as he looked at me, and I saw
that whatever he was thinking of it had not been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
far away from what I had been thinking of. &ldquo;No,
I haven&rsquo;t seen them&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;slowly. &ldquo;How is your
cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she seems to be all right. They were both
in to the store this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doing?&rdquo; I thought he was beginning to
worry, but I tried not to let on that I noticed it.
I was beginning to feel like a sleuth, or a detective,
or a diplomat, or something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Nell said they came in
to see me, but all that happened that I had any
hand in was to weigh her. She gained another
pound last week, and it&rsquo;s worrying her. The
more exercise she takes the heavier she gets, she
says. She&rsquo;s a hundred and thirty-one now. Of
course, while they&rsquo;re there Withrow had to help
out and make himself agreeable, especially to
Miss Foster, but I can&rsquo;t see that she warms up to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha? No? You don&rsquo;t think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, but maybe it&rsquo;s her way. She&rsquo;s
pretty frosty generally anyway, different from my
cousin&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s something like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your cousin is all right,&rdquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t stand around
and chill the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;does Miss Foster always? Is that her
way? I&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;know&ndash;&ndash;much about her.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know so very much myself&ndash;&ndash;mostly
what my cousin tells me. Still, I guess
she&rsquo;s all right; but she strikes me as one of the
kind that might make an awful lot of a man and
never let on until she was dead sure of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-m&ndash;&ndash;That means she could think a whole
lot of Withrow and not let on, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to look at Maurice like my oldest
brother used to look at me sometimes when he
tried to make me feel that I was a very green kid
indeed, and said, &ldquo;Well, if she&rsquo;s the kind to care
for a man like Withrow, all I&rsquo;ve got to say is that
she&rsquo;ll deserve all she&rsquo;ll get. He&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, but how&rsquo;s she to know? I
know, you know, and half the men in Gloucester
know that he&rsquo;s rotten; but take a woman who only
sees him at his best and when he&rsquo;s watching out&ndash;&ndash;how&rsquo;s
she to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but being a woman she ought
to,&rdquo; was all I could say to that. It came into my
mind just then that when I next saw my cousin
Nell I&rsquo;d tell her what I really knew, and more
than that&ndash;&ndash;what I really thought of my old employer.
Perhaps she&rsquo;d carry it to Miss Foster.
If it was to be Maurice or Withrow, I knew on
which side I was going to be.</p>
<p>Both of us were quiet then, neither of us quite
knowing what to say perhaps. Then together we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
started to walk to the corner of the side street.
We were past the side-door of the boarding-house
when a voice called out, &ldquo;Oh, Maurice,&rdquo; and
then, maybe noticing me, I suppose, &ldquo;Oh, Captain
Blake,&rdquo; and Maurice turned. Minnie Arkell&ndash;&ndash;Mrs.
Miner rather&ndash;&ndash;was there at the kitchen
window. I didn&rsquo;t know she was in town at all&ndash;&ndash;thought
she hadn&rsquo;t got back from Florida, or
North Carolina, or wherever it was she had been
for the winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in a minute, Captain, and
your friend? He doesn&rsquo;t remember me&ndash;&ndash;do you,
Joe?&ndash;&ndash;and yet we were playmates once,&rdquo; which
was true. I was often taken to Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s
when a little fellow by skippers who were friends
of my father&rsquo;s. They used to tell me about him,
and I liked to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d run over and see granny,&rdquo; she
went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back to the old house for a while.
Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mind had long been set against Minnie
Arkell. I knew about her throwing over a fine
young fellow, a promising skipper, to marry
Miner. I may have been too young at the time
to judge anybody, but after that I had small
use for her. My ideas in the matter were of
course pretty much what older men had put into
me.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>I had listened to them&ndash;&ndash;skippers and others&ndash;&ndash;and
yet now, when she held out her hand to me
and smiled, I didn&rsquo;t feel nearly so set against her.
She certainly was a handsome girl, and yet I hoped
that Maurice wouldn&rsquo;t fall in love with her, as
most everybody did that came to the Arkell house.</p>
<p>I said that I did not have time to come in, and
started to make off. Maurice asked me where I
was bound. I told him that I thought of taking
a look in at Crow&rsquo;s Nest and getting the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll get it there, sure enough. When
they can&rsquo;t tell you anything else up there they can
tell you what everybody&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo; He smiled at
that, turned slowly toward the side-door, as if he
would rather go with me to Crow&rsquo;s Nest, and I
went off.</p>
<p>Just outside the gate I saw Sam Hollis, a man
I never did like. Tommie Clancy, the man that
could size up a person quicker than anybody I&rsquo;d
ever met, used to say that deep down, if you could
get at Hollis, you&rsquo;d find a quitter, but that nobody
had ever got into him. I&rsquo;d been meeting Hollis
after every trip in for two years in Withrow&rsquo;s
store. He was a successful fisherman, and a
sharp, keen man ashore, but he was a man I never
quite took to. One of his ambitions, I felt satisfied,
was to be reckoned a devil of a fellow. He&rsquo;d
have given a year&rsquo;s earnings, I knew, to have people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
point him out on the street and say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
Sam Hollis&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s the boy to carry sail&ndash;&ndash;nobody
ever made him take his mains&rsquo;l in,&rdquo; the same as
they used to say of a half dozen or so that really
would carry sail&ndash;&ndash;that would drive a vessel under
before they would be the first to reef. But the
people didn&rsquo;t do that, although, let him tell it, he
did wonderful things out to sea, and he had such
a way of telling it, too, that he&rsquo;d almost make you
believe him. But as Clancy used to say, after he&rsquo;d
left you, and you had time to think it over, you&rsquo;d
see where here and there his story wasn&rsquo;t well-calked.
My own idea was that he wanted a reputation
so that he could pose as a devil of a fellow
with certain people ashore. It is easy enough to
see that even a more careful man than Sam Hollis
might take a chance for a smile from a woman
like Minnie Arkell.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I never felt at home with Hollis, and
so was willing to take Clancy&rsquo;s judgment straight.
Hollis was a man about forty, and had been one
of Minnie Arkell&rsquo;s admirers ever since I could remember&ndash;&ndash;ever
since she was old enough to have
any, I mean, and she wasn&rsquo;t any late bloomer, as
Clancy used to say.</p>
<p>Hollis went into the Arkell house by the door
that had only just closed behind Maurice and Minnie
Arkell. I didn&rsquo;t like that very much, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
thinking of turning back and going in, too; but
on second thought it occurred to me that perhaps
only Maurice would have a welcome for me. So I
didn&rsquo;t enter, but kept on to Crow&rsquo;s Nest instead.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>LITTLE JOHNNIE DUNCAN STANDS EXAMINATION</h3>
</div>
<p>By this time I should have gone home, I suppose,
and had something to eat&ndash;&ndash;it was
getting on into the afternoon&ndash;&ndash;but I didn&rsquo;t want
to have a talk with my mother yet awhile, and so
kept on to Crow&rsquo;s Nest, where I found half a
dozen good-natured loafers. Not all were loafers
exactly&ndash;&ndash;three or four were simply waiting around
before shipping on some seiner for the mackerel
season. It promised to shower at the time, too,
and of course the gentlemen who formed old
Peter&rsquo;s staff could not think of venturing out in
threatening weather.</p>
<p>And there they were, with Peter Hines, the paid
man in charge of Crow&rsquo;s Nest, keeping a benevolent
eye on them. Yarning, arguing, skylarking,
advising Peter, and having fun with little Johnnie
Duncan they were when I entered. Johnnie was
the grandson of the head of the Duncan firm, a
fine, clear-eyed boy, that nobody could help liking.
He thought fishermen were the greatest people
in the world. Whatever a fisherman did was
all right to Johnnie.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>I had got all the news at Crow&rsquo;s Nest and was
just thinking of moving along toward home when
Tommie Clancy popped in. Of course that made
a difference. I wasn&rsquo;t going to move while Clancy
was around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul, but here&rsquo;s where the real gentlemen
are,&rdquo; he had to say first, and then, &ldquo;Anybody seen
Maurice to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him I had, and where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not with him exactly.&rdquo; I shook my head,
and said nothing of Minnie Arkell, nor of Sam
Hollis, although Clancy, looking at me, I could
see, guessed that there was something else; and he
might have asked me something more only for the
crowd and little Johnnie Duncan.</p>
<p>Johnnie was trying to climb up onto Clancy,
and so Clancy, turning from me, took Johnnie up
and gave him a toss that all but hit his head against
the roof. &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s she heading, Johnnie-boy?&rdquo;
and taking a seat stood Johnnie up beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;East-s&rsquo;uth-east, and a fair, fair wind,&rdquo; answered
Johnnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;East-s&rsquo;uth-east&ndash;&ndash;my, but you said that fine.
And a fair wind? Must be bound Georges
Bank way. And how long will you hold that
course?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;From Eastern Point&ndash;&ndash;a hundred and thirty-five
mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;and then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you throw her up and heave the lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And heave the lead&ndash;&ndash;sure enough. And
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, if you find you&rsquo;re clear of the North
Shoal, you put her to the s&rsquo;uth&rsquo;ard and west&rsquo;ard
till you&rsquo;re in onto the Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;uth&rsquo;ard and west&rsquo;ard&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s the boy. Man,
but I&rsquo;ll live to see you going to the Custom House
and taking out your master&rsquo;s papers yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can I join the Master Mariners then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you can, and walk down Main
Street with a swing to your shoulders, too. And
now you&rsquo;re up on the Bank and twenty-five fathom
of water and the right bottom&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;re a hand-liner,
say, after cod&ndash;&ndash;what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go her chain and begin fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you give her a short or a long
string of cable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-m&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m not sure. A long string you&rsquo;d
hang on better, but a short scope and you could
get out faster in case you were dragging and going
onto the shoals. What would you do, Captain
Clancy? You never told me that, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would depend, too, though handliners
generally calculate on hanging on, blow how it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
will. But never mind that; suppose your anchor
dragged or parted and into the shoal water you
went in a gale, an easterly, say&ndash;&ndash;and the bank
right under your lee&ndash;&ndash;wind sixty or seventy or
eighty mile an hour&ndash;&ndash;what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchor not hold? M-m&ndash;&ndash;Then I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;give
her the second one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if that dragged, too&ndash;&ndash;or parted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of &rsquo;em? M-m&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Johnnie was taking
deep breaths now&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;why, then I&rsquo;d have to put
sail to her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, jib, jumbo, fore and main.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the wind blowing eighty mile an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, if she&rsquo;d stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but she&rsquo;d have to be an able vessel that&ndash;&ndash;all
four lowers and the wind blowing eighty mile
an hour. Man, but you&rsquo;re a dog! Suppose she
couldn&rsquo;t stand it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d reef the mains&rsquo;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if that was too much&ndash;&ndash;what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reef it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And too much yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Balance-reef it&ndash;&ndash;maybe take it in altogether&ndash;&ndash;and
the jib with it, and get out the riding-sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you do nothing to the fores&rsquo;l?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-m&ndash;&ndash;I dunno&ndash;&ndash;with some vessels maybe
I&rsquo;d reef that, too&ndash;&ndash;maybe take it in altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My, but you&rsquo;re cert&rsquo;nly a dog. And what
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then I&rsquo;d try to work her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you be doing anything with the
lead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;d be keeping the lead going all the
time, for banging her across and back like that
you wouldn&rsquo;t know where you were just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you come clear, d&rsquo;y&rsquo; think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;if the gear held and with an able
vessel we ought to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the gear held&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s it. Be sure, Johnnie-boy,
you see that the gear is all right before ever
you leave port. And with an able vessel, you say?
With that new one of your gran&rsquo;pa&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;would you
come clear with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;d come clear&ndash;&ndash;built to go fresh halibuting
next winter, that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;and seining this spring. But suppose
now you were haddocking&ndash;&ndash;trawling&ndash;&ndash;eight or
ten dories, and you just arrived on the grounds,
picked out a good spot, and there you are&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re
all baited up and ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winter time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winter time, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I&rsquo;d single-reef the mains&rsquo;l. Then I&rsquo;d
hold her up a little&ndash;&ndash;not too much&ndash;&ndash;me being
skipper would be to the wheel myself&ndash;&ndash;and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
I&rsquo;d give the order, &lsquo;Dories to the rail!&rsquo; and then,
when everything was all right&ndash;&ndash;when I&rsquo;d be satisfied
we wouldn&rsquo;t foul the next vessel&rsquo;s trawls&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d
call out, &lsquo;Over with your wind&rsquo;ard dory!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loud and clear you&rsquo;d holler, because the wind
might be high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loud and clear, yes&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Let go your wind&rsquo;ard
dory!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;like that. And &lsquo;Set to the west&rsquo;ard,&rsquo; or
the east&rsquo;ard, whatever it was&ndash;&ndash;according to the
tide, you know. I&rsquo;d call that out to the dory as
it went sliding by the quarter&ndash;&ndash;the vessel, of
course, &rsquo;d be sailing all the time&ndash;&ndash;and next,
&lsquo;Wind&rsquo;ard dory to the rail!&rsquo; And then, when
we&rsquo;d gone ahead enough, again, &lsquo;Let go your
looard dory!&rsquo; and then, &lsquo;Looard dory to the rail!
Let go your wind&rsquo;ard dory! Let go your looard
dory!&rsquo; and so till they were all over the side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And supposing, they being all out, it came on
thick, or snowing, and some of them went astray,
and it was time to go home, having filled her with
eighty or ninety or a hundred thousand of fresh
fish, a fair wind, and every prospect of a good
market&ndash;&ndash;what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d have to wait, of course&ndash;&ndash;cruise around
and stand by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose you couldn&rsquo;t find them again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, after waiting until I was sure they were
gone, I&rsquo;d come home.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And your flag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-mast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-mast&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s it. I hope you&rsquo;ll never
have to fly a half-masted flag, Johnnie. But suppose
you did see them, and they were in shoal
water, say&ndash;&ndash;and the shoals to looard, of course,
and it blowing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stand in and get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it blowing hard&ndash;&ndash;blowing hard, Johnnie?&ndash;&ndash;and
shoal&ndash;&ndash;shoal water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Johnnie was looking troubled&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;why,
I&rsquo;d have to stand in just the same, wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own men and you ask me, Johnnie-boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I&rsquo;d have to stand in and get
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you got in so far you couldn&rsquo;t get out&ndash;&ndash;you
got smothered, say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then&ndash;&ndash;then we&rsquo;d be lost&ndash;&ndash;all hands
would be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Johnnie! he was all but crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. And that&rsquo;s where some would say
you showed yourself a man, and some a fool,
Johnnie-boy. Some would say, &lsquo;Use judgment&ndash;&ndash;think
of the other eighteen or twenty men safe
aboard the vessel.&rsquo; Would you use judgment, or
what, Johnnie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-m&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know. What would you do,
Captain Clancy?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;y&rsquo; think I&rsquo;d do, Johnnie?&rdquo; Clancy
drew the boy up and tucked the little face to his
own broad breast. The rest of us knew well
enough what Clancy would do. &ldquo;Judgment hell!&rdquo;
Clancy would say, and go in and get lost&ndash;&ndash;or
maybe get away with it where a more careful man
would be lost&ndash;&ndash;but we waited to hear what Johnnie&ndash;&ndash;such
a little boy&ndash;&ndash;would say. He said it at last,
after looking long into Clancy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d go in, Captain Clancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy laughed at that. &ldquo;Lord, Johnnie-boy,
no wonder everybody loves you. No matter what
a man does, all you see is the best that&rsquo;s in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was time to clean up then, and Johnnie of
course was bound to help.</p>

<h2>V</h2>
<h3>FROM OUT OF CROW&rsquo;S NEST</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do with this?&rdquo; asked Johnnie,
in the middle of the cleaning up, holding
up a pan of sweepings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Clancy naturally took charge&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;heave
it overboard. Ebb tide&rsquo;ll carry it away.
Heave it into the slip. Wait&ndash;&ndash;maybe you&rsquo;ll have
to hoist the hatches. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t raining much now,
anyway, and it will soon stop altogether. Might
as well go aloft and make a good job of the
hatches, hadn&rsquo;t he, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo; Peter was squinting through
the porthole. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but this is one
of our fellows coming in. I know she&rsquo;s a banker.
The Enchantress, I think. Look, Tommie, and
see what you make of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy looked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s who it is, Peter. Hi,
Johnnie, here&rsquo;ll be a chance for you to hoist the
flag. Hurry aloft and tend to the hatches, as
Peter says, and you can hoist the flag for the Enchantress
home from the Banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In bad weather, like it was that day, the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
balcony of Crow&rsquo;s Nest was shut in by little
hatches, arranged so that they could be run up
and down, the same as hatches are slid over the
companionway of a fisherman&rsquo;s cabin or forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le.
Johnnie was a pretty active boy, and he was up the
rope ladder and onto the roof in a few seconds.
We could hear him walking above, and soon the
hatches slid away and we all could look freely out
to sea again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right below?&rdquo; called out Johnnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered Peter. He was standing
by the rail of the balcony and untwisting the halyards
that served to hoist the signal-flags to the
mast-head. Peter seemed slow at it, and Clancy
called out again, &ldquo;Wait a bit, and we&rsquo;ll overhaul
the halyards.&rdquo; Then, looking up and noticing that
Johnnie was standing on the edge of the roof, he
added, &ldquo;And be careful and not slip on those wet
planks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; Johnnie was in high glee. &ldquo;And
then I can run up the flag for the Enchantress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, you&rsquo;ve been such a good boy to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-m&ndash;&ndash;but that&rsquo;ll be fine. I can catch the halyards
from here if you&rsquo;ll swing them in a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&ndash;&ndash;be careful. Here you go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em come&ndash;&ndash;I got&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first thing we knew of what had happened
was when we saw Johnnie&rsquo;s body come pitching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
down. He struck old Peter first, staggering him,
and from there he shot down out of sight.</p>
<p>Clancy jumped to the rail in time to save Peter
from toppling over it and just in time, as he said
afterward, to see the boy splash in the slip below.
He yanked Peter to his feet, and then, without
turning around, he called out, &ldquo;A couple of you
run to the head of the dock&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;ll be a dory
there somewhere&ndash;&ndash;row &rsquo;round to the slip with it.
He&rsquo;ll be carried under the south side&ndash;&ndash;look for
him there if I&rsquo;m not there before you. Drive her
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Joe, wake up!&rdquo; Clancy had untied the
ends of the halyards after whirling them through
the block above, and now had the whole line piled
up on the balcony. He took a couple of turns
around his waist, took another turn around a cleat
under the balcony rail, passed the bight of the line
to me, and said, &ldquo;Here, Joe, lower me. Take hold
you, too, Peter. Pay out and not too careful. Oh,
faster, man! If he ain&rsquo;t dead he&rsquo;ll drown, maybe&ndash;&ndash;if
he gets sucked in and caught under those piles
it&rsquo;s all off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was sliding over the rail, the line tautening
to his weight in no time, and he talking all the
time. &ldquo;Lower away&ndash;&ndash;lower, lower! Faster&ndash;&ndash;faster
than that&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s rising again&ndash;&ndash;second time&ndash;&ndash;and
drifting under the wharf, sure&rsquo;s fate!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
Faster&ndash;&ndash;faster&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s wrong?&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s caught
there?&ndash;&ndash;let her run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The halyards had become fouled, and Peter was
trying to clear them, calling to Clancy to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fouled?&rdquo; roared Clancy. &ldquo;Cast it off altogether.
Let go altogether and let me drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;the bight of it&rsquo;s caught around
Peter&rsquo;s legs!&rdquo; I called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell! take a couple of half-hitches around
the cleat then&ndash;&ndash;look out now!&rdquo; He gripped the
halyards high above his head with both hands,
gave a jumping pull, and let himself drop. The
line parted and down he shot.</p>
<p>He must have been shaken by the shock of his
fall, but I guess he had his senses with him when
he came up again, for in no time he was striking
toward where Johnnie had come up last. Then I
ran downstairs, down to the dock, and was just
in time to see Parsons and Moore rowing a dory
desperately up the slip, and Clancy with Johnnie
chest-up, and a hand under his neck, kicking from
under the stringers, and calling out, &ldquo;This way
with the dory&ndash;&ndash;drive her, fellows, drive her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not wait for any more&ndash;&ndash;I knew Johnnie
was safe with Clancy&ndash;&ndash;but ran to the office of the
Duncans and told them that Johnnie had fallen
into the dock and got wet, and that it might be
well to telephone for a doctor. His grandfather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
knew it was serious without my saying any more,
and rang up at once.</p>
<p>That had hardly been done when Clancy came
in the door with Johnnie in his arms. The boy
was limp and unconscious and water was dripping
from him. Old Mr. Duncan was worried
enough, but composed in his manner for all that.
He met Clancy at the door. &ldquo;This way, Captain;
lay him on this couch. The doctor will be here
in a very few minutes now. Perhaps we can do
something while he is on the way. Just how did
it happen? and we&rsquo;ll know better what to do, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy told his story in forty words. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
probably shook up and his lungs must be full of
water. But he may come out all right&ndash;&ndash;his eyelids
quivered coming up the dock. Better strip
his shirt and waist off. He&rsquo;s got a lot of water in
him&ndash;&ndash;roll him over and we&rsquo;ll get some of it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He worked away on Johnnie, and had the water
pretty well out of him by the time the uncle and
the doctor came. It was hard work for a time,
but it came at last to when the doctor stood up,
rested his arms for a breath, said, &ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s all
right now,&rdquo; and went on again. It was not so
very long after that that Johnnie opened his eyes&ndash;&ndash;for
about a second. But pretty soon he opened
them to stay. His first look was for his grandfather,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
but his first word was for Clancy. &ldquo;I
could see you when you jumped, Captain Clancy&ndash;&ndash;it
was great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they bundled Johnnie into a carriage and
his uncle took him home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, but I thought he was gone, Joe. But
let&rsquo;s get out of this,&rdquo; said Clancy, and we were
making for the door, with Clancy&rsquo;s clothes still
wringing wet, when we were stopped by the elder
Mr. Duncan, who shook hands with both of us
and then went on to speak to Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Clancy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain once, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know, but not from lack of ability,
at any rate. Let me thank you. His mother will
thank you herself later, and make you feel, I
know, her sense of what she owes to you. And
his cousin Alice&ndash;&ndash;she thinks the world of him.
There, I know you don&rsquo;t want to hear any more,
but you shall&ndash;&ndash;maybe later&ndash;&ndash;though it may come
up in another way. But tell me&ndash;&ndash;wait, come inside
a minute. Come in you, too, Joe,&rdquo; he said,
turning to me, but I said I&rsquo;d rather wait outside.
I wanted to have a smoke to get my nerves steady
again, I guess.</p>
<p>So Clancy and Mr. Duncan went inside, and
through the window, whenever I looked up, I
could see them. As their talk went on I could see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
that they were getting very much interested about
something or other. Clancy particularly was laying
down the law with a clenched fist and an arm
that swung through the air like a jibing boom.
Somebody, I knew, was getting it.</p>
<p>When they came out Mr. Duncan stopped at
the door, and said, as if by way of a parting word,
&ldquo;And so you think that&rsquo;s the cause of Withrow&rsquo;s
picking a quarrel with Maurice? Well, I never
thought of that before, but maybe you&rsquo;re right.
And now, what do you say to a vessel for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me take a vessel? No, sir&ndash;&ndash;not for me. But
when you&rsquo;ve got vessels to hand around, Mr. Duncan,
bear Maurice in mind&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s a fisherman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We left Mr. Duncan then, he making ready to
telephone to learn how Johnnie was getting along.
Clancy said his clothes were beginning to feel so
dry that he did not know as he would go to his
boarding-house. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better go up to
the Anchorage and have a little touch. But I forgot&ndash;&ndash;you
don&rsquo;t drink, Joe? No? So I thought,
but don&rsquo;t you care&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re young yet. Come
along, anyway, and have a smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we went along to the Anchorage, and
while we were there, I smoking one of those barroom
cigars and Clancy nursing the after-taste of
his drink and declaring that a touch of good liquor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
was equal to a warm stove for drying wet clothes,
I told him what I would have told him in Crow&rsquo;s
Nest if there had not been so many around&ndash;&ndash;about
Minnie Arkell calling Maurice back into her
grandmother&rsquo;s house, and then Sam Hollis coming
along and going in after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; and stopped dead. Suddenly he
brought his fist through the air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and as
suddenly stopped it midway. &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, either.
But I&rsquo;ll put Maurice wise to them. What should
he know at his age and with his up-bringing of
what&rsquo;s in the heads of people like them. And if
I don&rsquo;t have something further to say to old Mr.
Duncan! But now let&rsquo;s go back to Arkell&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;come
on, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t go back with him. I didn&rsquo;t think
that I could do Maurice any good then, and I
might be in the way if Clancy wanted to speak his
mind out to anybody. I went home instead, where
I expected to have troubles of my own, for I knew
that my mother wouldn&rsquo;t like the idea of my going
seining.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>MAURICE BLAKE GETS A VESSEL</h3>
</div>
<p>Three days after Johnnie Duncan fell out
of Crow&rsquo;s Nest the new Duncan vessel designed
by Will Somers was towed around from
Essex. She had been named the Johnnie Duncan.
I spent the best part of the next three days watching
the sparmakers and riggers at work on her.
And when they had done with her and she fit to
go to sea, she did look handsome. She had not
quite the length of the new vessel of Sam Hollis&rsquo;s,
which lay at Withrow&rsquo;s dock just below her, and
that probably helped to give her a more powerful
look to people that compared them. Too able-looking
altogether to be real fast, some thought,
to hold the Withrow vessel in anything short of a
gale, but I didn&rsquo;t feel so sure she wouldn&rsquo;t sail
in a moderate breeze, too. I had seen her on the
stocks, and knew the beautiful lines below the
water-mark. And she was going to carry the sail
to drive her. I took particular pains to get the
measurements of her mainmast while it lay on the
dock under the shears. It was eighty-seven feet&ndash;&ndash;and
she only a hundred and ten feet over all&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
it stepped plumb in the middle of her, further forward
than a mainmast was generally put in a fisherman.
To that was shackled a seventy-five foot
boom, and eighty-odd tons of pig-iron were cemented
close down to her keel, and that floored
over and stanchioned snug. For the rest, she was
very narrow forward, as I think I said&ndash;&ndash;everybody
said she&rsquo;d never stand the strain of her fore-rigging
when they got to driving her on a long
passage. And she carried an ungodly bowsprit&ndash;&ndash;thirty-seven
feet outboard&ndash;&ndash;easily the longest
bowsprit out of Gloucester. Topmasts to match,
and there was some sail to drive a vessel. But
she had the hull for it, full and yet easy, with the
greatest beam pretty well aft of the mainmast,
and she drew fifteen and a half feet of water.</p>
<p>I was still looking her over, her third day in
the riggers&rsquo; and sailmakers&rsquo; hands, when Clancy
came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handsome, ain&rsquo;t she, and only needing a skipper
and crew to be off on the Southern cruise, eh,
Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. And according to the talk, you&rsquo;re
to be the skipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, talk has another according coming to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. But what happened at
Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s the other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened? Joe, but I was glad you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
didn&rsquo;t come with me. You&rsquo;d have felt as I did about
it, I know. There they were&ndash;&ndash;the two of them&ndash;&ndash;Hollis
and Withrow&ndash;&ndash;yes, Withrow there&ndash;&ndash;when
I broke in on them, and Maurice between them&ndash;&ndash;drunk.
Yes, sir, drunk and helpless. They called
it a wine-party, as though a man couldn&rsquo;t get as
good and drunk on wine in a private residence as
ever he could on whiskey or rum in the back room
of a saloon. Well, sir, I asked a question or two,
and they tried to face me out, but out they went&ndash;&ndash;first
Hollis, and then Withrow, one after the other,
and both good and lively. And then Minnie
Arkell popped in from her own house by way of
the backyard. She didn&rsquo;t expect to see me&ndash;&ndash;I
know she didn&rsquo;t. Had gone over to her house
when the men began to drink, she said, and had
just come over to see granny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I told her what I thought. &lsquo;It means
nothing to you,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;to see a man make a fool
of himself&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s been a good part of your business
in life for some time, now&ndash;&ndash;to see men make
fools of themselves for you. Withrow had reasons
for wanting him disgraced&ndash;&ndash;never mind why.
Sam Hollis, maybe, has his reasons too. And the
two of them are being helped along by you. You
could have stopped this thing here to-day, but
you didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no, Tommie,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;Yes,
yes,&rsquo; I went on, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t try to tell me different.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
If I didn&rsquo;t know you since you were a little girl
you might be able to convince me, but I know you.
Maurice, when he was himself, passed you by.
You were bound to have him. You know a real
man, more&rsquo;s the pity, when you see one, and you
know that Maurice, young and green and soft as
he is, has more life and dash than a dozen of the
kind you&rsquo;ve been mixing with lately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I laid it on, Joe. Yes. A shame to
have to talk like that to a woman, but I just had
to. I didn&rsquo;t stop there. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re handsome, and
you&rsquo;re rich, Minnie Arkell; got a lot of life left
in you yet, and go off travelling with people who
get their names regularly in the Boston papers;
but just the same, Minnie Arkell, there are women
in jail not half so bad as you&ndash;&ndash;women doing time
who&rsquo;ve done less mischief in the world than you
have.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that pretty rough, Tommie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rough? Lord, yes&ndash;&ndash;but true, Joe, true. And
if you&rsquo;d only see poor Maurice lying there!
Cried? I could&rsquo;ve cried, Joe&ndash;&ndash;not since my
mother died did I come so near to it. But it was
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I made Minnie go and get her
grandmother. And, Joe, if you&rsquo;d seen that fine
old lady&ndash;&ndash;oh, but she&rsquo;s got a heart in her&ndash;&ndash;stoop
and put Maurice&rsquo;s head on her bosom as if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
was a little child. &lsquo;The poor, poor boy. No mother
here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and the best man on earth might
come to it. Leave him to me, Tommie.&rsquo; Lord, I
could have knelt down at her feet&ndash;&ndash;the heart in
her, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how has Maurice been since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. That was the first time in his life
that he was drunk. I think it will be his last.
But let&rsquo;s go aboard the Johnnie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After looking over the Johnnie Duncan and
admiring her to our hearts&rsquo; content, we sat down
in her cabin and began to talk of the seining season
to come. Others came down and joined in&ndash;&ndash;George
Moore, Eddie Parsons among others&ndash;&ndash;and
they asked Clancy what he was going to do.
Was he going to see about a chance to go seining,
or what? Moore said he&rsquo;s been waiting to see
what Maurice Blake was going to do; but as it
was beginning to look as though Maurice was
done for, he guessed he&rsquo;d take a look around. He
asked Clancy what he thought, and Clancy said he
didn&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;time enough yet.</p>
<p>Maurice Blake himself dropped down then. He
was looking better, and everybody was glad to see
it. He&rsquo;d quit drinking&ndash;&ndash;that was certain; and
now he was a picture of a man&ndash;&ndash;not pretty, but
strong-looking, with his eyes glowing and his skin
flushing with the good blood inside him. He took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
a seat on the lockers and began to whittle a block
of soft pine into a model of a hull, and after a
while, with a squint along the sheer of his little
model, he asked if anybody had seen Tom O&rsquo;Donnell
or Wesley Marrs. Several said yes, they had,
and he asked where, and when they told him he
got up and said he guessed he&rsquo;d go along&ndash;&ndash;as he
couldn&rsquo;t get a vessel himself, he might as well see
about a chance to go hand. &ldquo;And as we&rsquo;ve been
together so much in times gone by, Tommie, and
you, Eddie and George, what do you say if we go
together now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Clancy, &ldquo;but wait a minute&ndash;&ndash;who&rsquo;s
that in the gangway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out to be Johnnie Duncan. He had
a fat bundle under his arm, and bundle and all
Clancy took him up, tossed him into the air, said
&ldquo;All right again, Johnnie-boy?&rdquo; and kissed him
when he caught him down.</p>
<p>Johnnie started to undo his bundle. &ldquo;I tell you
it&rsquo;s great to be out again&ndash;&ndash;the way they kept me
cooped up the last few days,&rdquo; and then, cutting the
string to hurry matters, opened the bundle and
spread a handsome set of colors on the lockers.
&ldquo;The Johnnie Duncan&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I picked out
the kind they were to be, but mummer worked
the monograms herself. See, red and blue. And
see that for an ensign! and the firm&rsquo;s flag&ndash;&ndash;and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
highs&ndash;&ndash;look!&ndash;&ndash;the J. A. D. twisted up the same
as on the handkerchiefs we strained the coffee
through last week. And the burgee&ndash;&ndash;the letters on
the burgee&ndash;&ndash;my cousin Alice worked them. And
these stars&ndash;&ndash;see, on the ensign&ndash;&ndash;mummer and my
cousin both worked them. Gran&rsquo;pa said the vessel
ought to be sure a lucky one, and all she needs
is an able master, he says, and if Captain Blake
will take her he&rsquo;ll be proud to have him sail the
Johnnie Duncan&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice Blake stood up. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnnie. &ldquo;Gran&rsquo;pa says that you
can have her just as soon as you go to the Custom
House and get your papers. There, I think I remembered
it all, except of course that the colors
are from me and mummer and my cousin Alice,
and will you fly them for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice laid down his model and picked up the
colors. Then he looked at Johnnie and said,
&ldquo;Thank you, Johnnie; and tell your mother, Johnnie,
and your cousin, that I&rsquo;ll fly the Johnnie Duncan&rsquo;s
colors&ndash;&ndash;and stand by them&ndash;&ndash;if ever it comes
to standing by&ndash;&ndash;till she goes under. Tell your
grandfather that I&rsquo;ll be proud to be master of his
vessel and I&rsquo;ll sail her the best I know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you, Maurice,&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>Maurice drew his hand across his eyes and sat
down again. And as soon as they decently could,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
Clancy, George Moore, and Eddie Parsons asked
him if they might ship with him for the Southern
cruise. Maurice said they very well knew that
he&rsquo;d be glad to have them. He asked me, too, he
felt so good, and of course I jumped at the chance.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>CLANCY CROSSES MINNIE ARKELL</h3>
</div>
<p>The Johnnie Duncan only needed to have her
stores taken aboard to go to sea. And that
was attended to next morning, and she was out for
her trial trip the same afternoon. Everybody
said she looked as handsome as a photograph going
out, though all the old sharks, when they saw her
mainsail hoisted for the first time, said she&rsquo;d certainly
have need of her quarter and draught to
stand up under it.</p>
<p>It was a great day for sailing, though&ndash;&ndash;the finest
kind of a breeze, and smooth water. We early
carried away our foretopmast, which had a flaw in
it. It was just as well to discover it then. Without
topsail and balloon we had it out with the Eastern
Point on her way back from Boston. She was not
much of a steamer for speed, but her schedule
called for twelve knots and she generally made
pretty near it&ndash;&ndash;eleven or eleven and a half, according
to how her stokers felt, I guess. We headed
her off after a while, and that was doing pretty well
for that breeze, with a new vessel not yet loosened
up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But the balloon was too much for her,&rdquo; said
Mr. Duncan, as we shot into the dock after beating
the Eastern Point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the balloon was all right&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;twas the
topm&rsquo;st was a bit light,&rdquo; answered Maurice.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Duncan smiled at that. &ldquo;But what do
you think of her, Captain Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s like all the rest of them when she&rsquo;s
alone&ndash;&ndash;sails like the devil,&rdquo; the skipper answered
to that, but he smiled with it and we all knew he
was satisfied with her.</p>
<p>That night was the Master Mariners&rsquo; Ball, and
I waited up till late to talk with my cousin Nell,
who had gone there with Will Somers. Finally
they came along past my house and I hailed them.</p>
<p>Nell broke right in as usual with what was uppermost
in her mind. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you saw me
and Alice, but we were in Mr. Duncan&rsquo;s office when
you and Mr. Clancy and Captain Blake were coming
up the dock to-day after the trial trip. Mr.
Duncan told us what Captain Blake said of the
Johnnie Duncan, but now tell me, what did the
rest of you think of her? What does your friend
Clancy say? He knows a vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clancy,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;thought what we all
thought, I guess&ndash;&ndash;that she&rsquo;s a fast vessel any way
you take her, but he won&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s the fastest
vessel out of Gloucester, even after she&rsquo;s put in trim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
and loosened up. But in a sea-going way and with
wind enough&ndash;&ndash;with wind enough, mind&ndash;&ndash;he thinks
she&rsquo;ll do pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With wind enough and in a sea-way?&rdquo; repeated
Nell. &ldquo;Then I hope that when the fishermen&rsquo;s
race is sailed next fall it&rsquo;s a howling gale
and seas clear to your mast-head. Yes, and you
needn&rsquo;t laugh&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you know what it means to
Will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I did realize. Somers, a fine fellow, was
just then beginning to get a chance at designing
fishermen. So far he had done pretty well, but
it was on the Johnnie Duncan, I knew, he had
pinned his faith. For his own sake, I hoped
that the Johnnie would do great things, but for
Nell&rsquo;s sake I prayed she would. Nell thought a
lot of Will and wasn&rsquo;t ashamed to show her liking,
and thinking of that set me to thinking of other
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Miss Foster to the ball?&rdquo; I asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was,&rdquo; said Nell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Withrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h, Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h!&ndash;&ndash;and why Oh-h-h?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she&rsquo;d gone with Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-m&ndash;&ndash;that was drunk the other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose that queers him forever. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
the other fellow does ten times as bad, only under
cover. Who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Maurice to the ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Was Mrs. Miner there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Miner?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and such a sniff!&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;yes, she
was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Sam Hollis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and flirted with half the men in the hall
and with your Maurice Blake outrageously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so? Could Maurice help that much?
But I wish, just the same, that Miss Foster had
gone with Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was one very good reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t ask her. And Mr. Withrow made a
handsome cavalier anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A handsome&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;I was going to say lobster,
but I didn&rsquo;t. Instead I told her why Maurice
didn&rsquo;t ask Miss Foster&ndash;&ndash;that he didn&rsquo;t think
enough of himself, probably. And that led up to a
talk about Maurice Blake and Clancy. Before I
got through I had Nell won over. Indeed, I think
she was won over before I began at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole lot you don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
said at last. &ldquo;Get Captain Blake to make a name
for himself seining, and for sailing his vessel as
she ought to be sailed, and I&rsquo;ll get down on my
knees to Alice for him&ndash;&ndash;sail her as she ought to be
sailed, remember. And make a good stock with
her, and you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, as I walked down the street with Nell and
Will Somers a part of the way, the talk was in
that strain, and when I left them, after passing
Sam Hollis bound home, it was with the hope of
things coming out all right. I was feeling happy
until I got near Minnie Arkell&rsquo;s door, where my
worrying began again, for there on the steps and
in the glare of the electric light was Minnie Arkell
herself, as though she were waiting for somebody.
And not wanting to have her know that I
saw her waiting at her door steps at that time of
night, I stepped in the shadows until she should
go in. It was then that Maurice came along, and
she called him up. And he went up and stood on
the step below her and she bent over him as if she
wanted to lift him up. And it was less than five
minutes since Sam Hollis left her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come around by way of the side door of
grandma&rsquo;s house, Maurice, and through her yard
and into my house, and nobody will see you. And
then no old grannies will talk and we&rsquo;ll have a little
supper all to ourselves. Hurry now.&rdquo; She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
talking as if she owned him. I did not hear
what Maurice said, nor I did not want to hear;
but making for the corner, he went by me like a
shot, and &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; I heard him groan as he
passed me, not recognizing me&ndash;&ndash;not even seeing
me, I believe.</p>
<p>I did not know what to make of it and let him
go by. But after he had turned the corner and
Minnie Arkell had shut her door&ndash;&ndash;and she watched
him till he disappeared around the corner&ndash;&ndash;I ran
after him. In my hurrying after him I heard the
voice of Clancy coming down the street. He was
singing. I had heard from Nell of Clancy being
at the ball, where he was as usual in charge of the
commissary. I could imagine how they must have
drove things around the punch-bowl with Clancy
to the wheel. He was coming along now and for
blocks anybody that was not dead could hear him.
And getting nearer I had to admire him. He was
magnificent, even with a list to port. Not often, I
imagined, did men of Clancy&rsquo;s lace and figure get
into evening dress. The height and breadth of
him!&ndash;&ndash;and spreading enough linen on his shirt
front to make a sail for quite a little vessel. He
was almost on top of me, with</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hove flat down on th&rsquo; Western Banks</p>
<p>Was the Bounding Billow, Captain Hanks&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>when I hailed him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloh, if it ain&rsquo;t Joe Buckley. Why, Joey,
but aren&rsquo;t you out pretty late to-night? But maybe
you&rsquo;re only standing watch for somebody? Three
o&rsquo;clock, Joey, and no excuse for you, for you didn&rsquo;t
have to stand by the supplies&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; But then I
rushed him around the corner, and down the street
to the side door of Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s and just in time
to head off Maurice, bound as I knew for Minnie
Arkell&rsquo;s house across the yard. I didn&rsquo;t have
a chance to say a word to Tommie, but he didn&rsquo;t
have to be told. If I&rsquo;d been explaining for a
week he couldn&rsquo;t have picked things up any better
than he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice&ndash;&ndash;hi, Maurice! Oh, &rsquo;tis you, isn&rsquo;t it.
Well, Maurice-boy, all the night I waited for a
chance to have a word with you, but ne&rsquo;er a chance
could I get. Early in the evening&ndash;&ndash;when I was
fit for ladies&rsquo; company&ndash;&ndash;Miss Foster said how
proud she was to know me&ndash;&ndash;me, who had saved
her cousin Johnnie&rsquo;s life. And then she asked me
about the vessel, and I told her, Maurice, that
nothing like the Duncan ever pushed salt water
from out of her way before. &lsquo;Nothing with two
sticks in her,&rsquo; says I, and I laid it on thick; &lsquo;and
Maurice Blake,&rsquo; says I&ndash;&ndash;and there, Maurice, I
only spoke true catechism. &lsquo;Maurice Blake,&rsquo; says
I, &lsquo;is the man to sail her.&rsquo; She was glad, she
said, to know that, because her chum, Miss Buckley&ndash;&ndash;Joe&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
cousin there&ndash;&ndash;wanted that particular
vessel to be a success. And she herself was interested
in it. Never mind the reasons, she said.
And she always did believe&ndash;&ndash;and, Maurice, listen
now&ndash;&ndash;she knew that Captain Blake would do the
Johnnie Duncan justice. And I said to her&ndash;&ndash;well,
Maurice, what I said you can guess well
enough. No, come to think, you can&rsquo;t guess, but I
won&rsquo;t tell you to your face. But thinking of it now,
I mind, Maurice, the time when we were dory-mates&ndash;&ndash;you
and me, Maurice&ndash;&ndash;and the cold winter&rsquo;s
day our dory was capsized. And dark coming
on and nothing in sight, and I could see you
beginning to get tired. But tired as you were,
Maurice, tired as you were and the gray look
beginning to creep over you, you says, &lsquo;Tommie,
take the plug strap for a while, you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t take it, Tommie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t take it&ndash;&ndash;and why? I didn&rsquo;t take
it&ndash;&ndash;and why? Because, though the mothers that
bore us both were great women&ndash;&ndash;all fire and iron&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;twas
in me to last longer&ndash;&ndash;you a boy and your
first winter fishing, and me a tough, hard old trawler.
And you had all of life before you, and I&rsquo;d run
through some hard years of mine. If I&rsquo;d gone
&rsquo;twould have been no great loss, but you, Maurice,
innocent as a child&ndash;&ndash;how could I? I&rsquo;d known men
and women, good and bad&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d lived life and I&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
had my chance and thrown it away&ndash;&ndash;but at your
age the things you had to learn! Maybe I didn&rsquo;t
think it all out like that, but that was why I didn&rsquo;t
take the plug strap. But, Maurice-boy, I never
forgot it. &lsquo;Take the plug strap, you, Tommie,&rsquo;
you says. We were dory-mates, of course, but,
Maurice-boy, I&rsquo;ll never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy took off his hat and drew his hand across
his forehead. &ldquo;And where were you bound when
we stopped you, Maurice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. To take a walk maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and why not? Let&rsquo;s all take a walk.
Let&rsquo;s take a walk down to the dock and have a
look at the vessel. Too dark? So it is, but we
can see the shadow of her masts rising up to the
clouds and we can open up the cabin and go below
and have a smoke. Come, Maurice. Come
on, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And down to the cabin of the Johnnie Duncan
we went, and Clancy never in such humor. For
three hours&ndash;&ndash;from a little after three o&rsquo;clock until
after six&ndash;&ndash;we sat on the lockers, Clancy talking
and we smoking and roaring at him. Only the
sun coming up over Eastern Point, lighting up the
harbor and striking into the cabin of the Johnnie
Duncan, brought Clancy to a halt.</p>
<p>He moved then and we with him. We left
Maurice at the door of old Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s, the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
lady herself in the doorway and asking us if we
had a good time at the ball. Standing on the
steps, before he went in, Maurice said to me:
&ldquo;Tell your cousin, Joe, that when I do race the
Johnnie, I&rsquo;ll take the spars out of her before anything
gets by&ndash;&ndash;take the spars out or send her
under. I can&rsquo;t do any more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Johnnie Duncan was to leave at ten o&rsquo;clock
and so I left Clancy at his boarding-house. He
looked tired when I left him. But he was chuckling,
too. I asked him what it was that made him
smile so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you three guesses,&rdquo; he said, but I
didn&rsquo;t guess.</p>

<h3>THE SEINING FLEET PUTS OUT TO SEA</h3>
</div>
<p>The rest of that morning, between leaving
Clancy and getting back to the dock again,
I spent in cleaning up and overhauling my home
outfit. My mother couldn&rsquo;t be made to believe
that store bedding was of much use&ndash;&ndash;and she was
right, I guess&ndash;&ndash;and so a warranted mattress and
blankets and comforters and a pillow were made
into a bundle and thrown onto a waiting wagon.
Then it was good-by to all&ndash;&ndash;good-by to my cousin
Nell, who had come over from her house, good-by
and a kiss for her little sister&ndash;&ndash;late for school
she was, but didn&rsquo;t care she said&ndash;&ndash;and then good-by
to my mother. That took longer. Then it was
into the wagon with my bedding and off to the
dock.</p>
<p>At Duncan&rsquo;s store I had charged up to me such
other stuff as I needed: Two suits of oilskins,
yellow and black, two sou&rsquo;westers, heavy and light,
two blue-gray flannel shirts, a black sweater, a pair
of rubber boots, two pairs of woollen mitts and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
four pairs of cotton mitts, five pounds of smoking
tobacco, a new pipe, and so on. When I had all
my stuff tied up, I swung up abreast of Clancy
and together we headed for the end of Duncan&rsquo;s
dock, where the Johnnie Duncan lay.</p>
<p>Quite a fleet went out ahead of us that morning.
Being a new vessel, there was a lot of things that
were not ready until the last minute. And then
there was the new foretopmast&ndash;&ndash;promised at nine
o&rsquo;clock it was&ndash;&ndash;not slung and stayed up until after
ten. And then our second seine, which finally we
had to leave for Wesley Marrs to take next morning.
And there were the usual two or three men
late. Clancy and Andie Howe went up to have a
farewell drink and were gone so long that the
skipper sent me after them. I found them both in
the Anchorage, where Clancy had met a man he
hadn&rsquo;t seen for ten years&ndash;&ndash;an old dory-mate&ndash;&ndash;thought
he was lost five years before in the West
Indies. &ldquo;But here he is, fine and handsome. Another
little touch all around and a cigar for Joe,
and we&rsquo;re off for the Southern cruise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We left then and started for the dock, with
Clancy full of poetry. There happened to be a
young woman looking out of a window on the
way down. Clancy did not know her, nor she him,
so far as I knew, but something about him seemed
to take her eye. She leaned far out and waved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
her handkerchief at him. That was enough.
Clancy broke out&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;The wind blows warm and the wind blows fair,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Oh, the wind blows westerly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Our jibs are up and our anchor&rsquo;s in,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>For the Duncan&rsquo;s going to sea.</p>
<p>And will you wait for me, sweetheart?</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Oh, will you wait for me?</p>
<p>And will you be my love again</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>When I come back from sea?</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sway away and start her sheets</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And point her easterly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tackle-pennant, boom her out</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And turn the Duncan free.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see some sailing now, my boys,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>We&rsquo;re off for the Southern cruise&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll try to hold the Johnnie D,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>But they&rsquo;ll find it of no use.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wait any longer than that for Clancy,
but ran ahead to the Duncan. I found her with
jibs up and paying off. I was in time to get
aboard without trouble, but Clancy and Howe
coming later had to make a pier-head jump of it.
Clancy, who could leap like a hound&ndash;&ndash;drunk or
sober&ndash;&ndash;made it all right with his feet on the
end of the bowsprit and his fingers on the
balloon stay when he landed, but Howe fell
short, and we had the liveliest kind of a time
gaffing him in over the bow, he not being able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
to swim. They must have heard us yelling clear
to Eastern Point, I guess. Andie didn&rsquo;t mind.
&ldquo;I must be with a lot of dogs&ndash;&ndash;have to jump
overboard to get aboard.&rdquo; He spat out what
water he had to, and started right in to winch
up the mainsail with the gang. He had on a
brand-new suit, good cloth and a fine fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon dry out in the sun, Andie-boy,&rdquo;
they all said to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so. But will my clothes ever fit me
again like they did?&ndash;&ndash;and my fine new patent-leather
shoes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drifting down by the dock next to Duncan&rsquo;s
our long bowsprit almost swept off a row of old
fellows from the cap-log. They had to scramble,
but didn&rsquo;t mind. &ldquo;Good luck, and I hope you fill
her up,&rdquo; they called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll try and get our share of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; our
fellows called back.</p>
<p>There was a young woman on the next dock&ndash;&ndash;one
of the kind that quite often come down to take
snap-shots. A stranger to Gloucester she must
have been, for not only that Gloucester girls don&rsquo;t
generally come down to the docks to see the fishermen
off, but she said good-by to us. She meant
all right, but she should never have said good-by
to a fisherman. It&rsquo;s unlucky. Too many of them
don&rsquo;t come back, and then the good-by comes true.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>Andie Howe looked a funny sight when we
were making sail. Clancy, who, once he got
started, took a lot of stopping, was still going:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Johnnie Duncan, fast and able&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Good-by, dear, good-by, my Mabel&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And will you save a kiss for me</p>
<p>When I come back from sea?&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; roared Andie,</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget I love you, dear,</p>
<p>And save a kiss for me,&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>with the salt water dripping from his fine new suit
of clothes and the patent-leather shoes he was so
fond of.</p>
<p>And Clancy again:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a deep blue sky and a deep blue sea</p>
<p>And a blue-eyed girl awaiting me,&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>and Howe,</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, too-roo-roo and a too-roo-ree</p>
<p>And a hi-did-dy ho-did-dy ho-dee-dee,&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>and Clancy,</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Too-roo-roo and a too-roo-ree,</p>
<p>The Johnnie Duncan&rsquo;s going to sea,&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>and Howe&ndash;&ndash;a little shy on the words&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Tum-did-dy dum-did-dy dum-did-dy-dum,</p>
<p>Hoo-roo-roo and a dum by gum.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>And by that time the gang were joining in and
sheeting flat the topsails with a great swing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose that Gloucester Harbor will
ever again look as beautiful to me as it did that
morning when we sailed out. Forty sail of seiners
leaving within two hours, and to see them going&ndash;&ndash;to
see them one after another loose sails and up
with them, break out anchors, pay off, and away!
It was the first day of April and the first fine day
in a week, and those handsome vessels going out
one after the other in their fresh paint and new
sails&ndash;&ndash;it was a sight to make a man&rsquo;s heart thump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Johnnie Duncan, seiner of Gloucester&ndash;&ndash;watch
her walk across the Bay to-day,&rdquo; was
George Moore&rsquo;s little speech when he came on
deck to heave his first bucket of scraps over the
rail. George was cook.</p>
<p>And she did walk. We squared away with half
a dozen others abreast of us and Eastern Point
astern of us all. Among the forty sail of fishermen
that were standing across the Bay that morning
we knew we&rsquo;d find some that could sail. There
was the Ruth Ripley, Pitt Ripley&rsquo;s vessel. He
worked her clear of the bunch that came out of
the harbor and came after us, and we had it with
him across to Cape Cod. Forty miles before we
beat him; but Pitt Ripley had a great sailer in the
Ruth, and we would have been satisfied to hold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
her even. &ldquo;Only wait till by and by, when we
get her in trim,&rdquo; we kept saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;ll smother some of them yet,&rdquo; said
Eddie Parsons, looking back at the Ruth. He
felt pretty good, because he had the wheel when
we finally crossed the Ruth&rsquo;s bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With good steering&ndash;&ndash;yes,&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; exclaimed Eddie to that, and filled
his chest full, and then, looking around and catching
everybody laughing, let his chest flatten again.</p>
<p>The skipper didn&rsquo;t have much to say right away
about her sailing. He was watching her, though.
He&rsquo;d look at her sails, have an eye on how they
set and drew, take a look over her quarter, another
look aloft, and then back at the Ruth, then
a look for the vessels still ahead. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know
more about it after we&rsquo;ve tried her out with the
Lucy Foster or the Colleen Bawn or Hollis&rsquo;s new
vessel,&rdquo; he said, after a while.</p>
<p>One thing we soon found out, and that was that
she was a stiff vessel. That was after a squall hit
us off Cape Cod. We watched the rest of them
then. Some luffed and others took in sail, and
about them we could not tell. But those that took
it full gave us an idea of how we were behaving.
&ldquo;Let her have it and see how she&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the
skipper, and Howe, who was at the wheel&ndash;&ndash;with
his clothes good and dry again&ndash;&ndash;let her have it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
full. With everything on and tearing through
the water like a torpedo-boat, one puff rolled her
down till she filled herself chock up between the
house and rail, but she kept right on going. Some
vessels can&rsquo;t sail at all with decks under, but the
Johnnie never stopped. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right, this one,&rdquo;
said everybody then. A second later she took a
slap of it over her bow, nearly smothering the
cook, who had just come up to dump some potato
parings over the rail. The way he came up coughing
and spitting and then his dive for the companionway&ndash;&ndash;everybody
had to roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did y&rsquo;see the cook hop?&ndash;&ndash;did y&rsquo;see him hop?&rdquo;
called Andie, who was afraid somebody had
missed it.</p>
<p>We passed the Marauder, Soudan McLeod,
soon after. His mainmast had broken off eight
or ten feet below the head. They were clearing
away the wreckage. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I oughter had more
sense,&rdquo; he called out as we went by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;maybe the spar was rotten,&rdquo;
said Maurice, and that was a nice way to
put it, too.</p>
<p>That night it came a flat calm, and with barely
steerage way for us. There was a big four-masted
coaster bound south, too, and light, and for the
best part of the night we had a drifting match
with her. Coasters as a rule are not great all-round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
sailers, but some of them, with their flat
bottoms and shoal draft, in a fair wind and going
light, can run like ghosts, and this was one of
that kind. We had our work cut out to hold this
one while the wind was light and astern, but in
the morning, when it hauled and came fresher, we
went flying over the shoals. So far as the looks
of it went the big coaster might as well have been
anchored then.</p>
<p>All that day we held on. And it was a lesson
in sailing to see the way some of those seiners
were handled. Our skipper spent most of that
day finding out how she sailed best and putting
marks on her sheets for quick trimming by and by.</p>
<p>Trying each other out, measuring one vessel
against another, the fleet went down the coast.
We passed a few and were passed by none, and
that was something. Ahead of us somewhere
were a half-dozen flyers. If we could have beaten
some of them we should have had something to
brag about; but no telling, we might get our
chance yet.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>MACKEREL</h3>
</div>
<p>Throughout all that night the lights of
the fleet were all about us, ahead and behind.
At breakfast next morning&ndash;&ndash;four o&rsquo;clock&ndash;&ndash;we
were off Delaware Breakwater, and that
afternoon at two we began the mast-head watch
for fish. And on that fine April day it was a
handsome sight&ndash;&ndash;forty sail of seiners in sight,
spread out and cruising lazily.</p>
<p>The skipper was the first to get into his oilskins
and heavy sweater, for with a vessel hopping along
at even no more than six or seven knots by the
wind it is pretty chilly aloft, nice and comfortable
though it may be on deck in the sun.</p>
<p>There was a game of seven-up going on in the
cabin, and the sun striking down the companionway
was bothering Andie Howe. He began to
complain. &ldquo;Hi, up there to the wheel! Hi,
Eddie&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t you put her on the other tack?&ndash;&ndash;the
sun&rsquo;s in my eyes. How can a man see the
cards with the sun in his eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parsons didn&rsquo;t have the chance to talk back
when the word came from aloft to put the seine-boat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
over the side, and after that to overhaul the
seine and pile it in the boat. Vessels ahead had
seen mackerel, the skipper called out. We got
into oilskins and boots and made ready. Those
who were going into the seine-boat had already
picked out in what positions they were going to
row, and now there was an overhauling of oars
and putting marks on them so that they could be
picked out in a hurry. Clancy and I were to be
dorymen. We made ready the dory, and then
Clancy went to the mast-head with the skipper and
Long Steve, whose watch it was aloft.</p>
<p>Things began to look like business soon. Even
from the deck we could see that one or two vessels
ahead had boats out. We began to picture
ourselves setting around a big school and landing
the first mackerel of the year into New York. I
think everybody aboard was having that dream,
though everybody pretended not to be in earnest.
You could hear them: &ldquo;A nice school now&ndash;&ndash;three
hundred barrels.&rdquo; &ldquo;Or two hundred would be
doing pretty well.&rdquo; &ldquo;Or even a hundred barrels
wouldn&rsquo;t be bad.&rdquo; There were two or three young
fellows among the crew, fellows like myself, who
had never seen much seining, and they couldn&rsquo;t
keep still for excitement when from the mast-head
came the word that a boat ahead was out and
making a set.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>We were going along all the time and when
we could see from the deck for ourselves the boats
that were setting, Billie Hurd couldn&rsquo;t stand it
any longer, but had to go aloft, too. The four
of them made a fine picture&ndash;&ndash;the skipper and Steve
standing easily on the spreaders, one leaning
against the mast and the other against the back-stay,
with Hurd perched on the jib halyards block
and Clancy on the spring-stay, and all looking as
comfortable as if they were in rockers at home.
I&rsquo;d have given a hundred dollars then to be able
to stand up there on one foot and lean as easily as
the skipper against the stay with the vessel going
along as she was. I made up my mind to practise
it when next I went aloft.</p>
<p>I went to the mast-head myself by and by, and,
seeing half a dozen schools almost at once, I became
so excited that I could hardly speak. The
skipper was excited, too, but he didn&rsquo;t show it,
only by his eyes and talking more jerkily than
usual. He paid no attention to two or three
schools that made me just crazy just to look at,
but at last, when he thought it was time, he began
to move. Ten or a dozen Gloucester vessels
were bunched together, and one porgy steamer&ndash;&ndash;that
is, built for porgy or menhaden fishing,
but just now trying for mackerel like the rest of
us.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be plenty of them up soon, don&rsquo;t you
think, Tommie?&rdquo; the skipper asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; answered Tommie, &ldquo;plenty,&rdquo; with
his eyes ever on the fish. &ldquo;I think Sam Hollis
has got his all right, but Pitt Ripley&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was getting well along toward sunset then,
with everybody worried, the skipper still aloft, and
one boat making ready to set about a mile inside
of us. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll dive,&rdquo; said our skipper, and
they did. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Pitt Ripley&rsquo;s school now,&rdquo; and
he pointed to where a raft of mackerel were rising
and rippling the water black, and heading for the
north. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another gone down, too&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;ll
dive that fellow. Who is it&ndash;&ndash;Al McNeill?&ndash;&ndash;yes.
But they&rsquo;ll come up again, and when it
does, it&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo; And they did come up, and when
they did the skipper made a jump and roared,
&ldquo;Into the boat!&rdquo; There was a scramble. &ldquo;Stay
up here, you Billie, and watch the school,&rdquo; he said
to Hurd, and &ldquo;Go down, you,&rdquo; to me. I slid
down by the jib halyards. The skipper and
Clancy came down by the back-stay and beat me
to the deck. They must have tumbled down, they
were down so quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry&ndash;&ndash;the Aurora&rsquo;s going after it, too.&rdquo;
The Aurora was one of Withrow&rsquo;s fleet and we
were bound to beat her. I had hardly time to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
leap into the dory after Clancy, and we were off,
with nobody left aboard but Hurd to the mast-head
and the cook, who was to stay on deck and
sail the vessel.</p>
<p>In the seine-boat it was double-banked oars,
nine long blades and a monstrous big one steering&ndash;&ndash;good
as another oar that&ndash;&ndash;and all driving for
dear life, with Long Steve and a cork-passer
standing by the seine and the skipper on top of
it, with his eyes fixed on the school ahead&ndash;&ndash;his
only motions to open his mouth and to wave with
his hands to the steersman behind him. &ldquo;Drive
her&ndash;&ndash;drive her,&rdquo; he called to the crew. &ldquo;More
yet&ndash;&ndash;more yet,&rdquo; to the steering oar. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
porgy steamer&rsquo;s boat, too, after the same school.
Drive her now, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mackerel were wild as could be, great rafts
of them, and travelling faster than the old seiners
in the gang said they had ever seen them travel
before, and what was worse, not staying up long.
There were boats out from three or four vessels
before we pushed off with ours. I remember the
porgy steamer had cut in ahead and given their
boat a long start for a school. However, that
school did not stay up long enough and they had
their row for nothing. But then their steamer
picked them up again and dropped them on the
way to the same school that we were trying for.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
How some of our gang did swear at them! And
all because they were steam power.</p>
<p>It promised to be a pretty little race, but that
school, too, went down before either of us could
head it, and so it was another row for nothing.
We lay on our oars then, both boats ready for
another row, with the skipper and seine-heaver in
each standing on top of the seine and watching
for the fish to show again. Of course both
gangs were sizing each other up, too. I think
myself that the Duncan&rsquo;s crowd were a huskier
lot of men than the steamer&rsquo;s. Our fellows looked
more like fishermen, as was to be expected, because
in Gloucester good fishermen are so common that
naturally, a man hailing from there gets so that
he wants to be a good fisherman, too, and of course
the men coming there are all pretty good to begin
with, leaving out the fellows who are born and
brought up around Gloucester and who have it in
their blood. A man doesn&rsquo;t leave Newfoundland
or Cape Breton or even Nova Scotia or Maine
and the islands along the coast, or give up any
safe, steady work he may have, to come to
Gloucester to fish unless he feels that he can come
pretty near to holding his end up. That&rsquo;s not
saying that a whole lot of fine fishermen do not
stay at home, with never any desire to fish out of
Gloucester, in spite of the good money that a fisherman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
with a good skipper can make from there,
but just the same they&rsquo;re a pretty smart and able
lot that do come. And so, while our gang was
half made up of men that were born far away
from Gloucester, yet they had the Gloucester
spirit, which is everything in deep-sea fishing,
when nerve and strength and skill count for so
much. And this other crowd&ndash;&ndash;the porgy steamer&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;did
not have that look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at what we&rsquo;re coming to,&rdquo; somebody
called. &ldquo;All steam boys soon, and on wages&ndash;&ndash;wages!&rdquo;
he repeated, &ldquo;and going around the
deck, with a blue guernsey with letters on the chest
of it&ndash;&ndash;A.D.Q.&ndash;&ndash;or some other damn company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that would not be bad either, with your
grub bill sure and your money counted out at the
end of every month,&rdquo; answered somebody else.</p>
<p>I was sizing up the two gangs myself, I being
in the dory with Clancy, and I guess that nearly
everyone of us was doing the same thing and
keeping an eye out for fish at the same time, when
all at once a school popped up the other side of
the porgyman&rsquo;s boat. Perhaps, half a mile it was
and, for a wonder, not going like a streak.</p>
<p>We saw it first and got to going first, but the
Aurora&rsquo;s boat and the steamer&rsquo;s boat were nearer,
and so when we were all under good headway
there were two lengths or so that we had to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
up on each. Well, that was all right. Two
lengths weren&rsquo;t so many, and we drove her. It
was something to see the fellows lay out to it
then&ndash;&ndash;doubled-banked, two men to each wide seat
and each man with a long oar, which he had
picked out and trimmed to suit himself, and every
man in his own particular place as if in a racing
crew.</p>
<p>And now every man was bending to it. A big
fellow, named Rory McKinnon, was setting the
stroke. There was a kick and a heave to every
stroke, and the men encouraging each other.
&ldquo;Now&ndash;&ndash;now&ndash;&ndash;give it to her,&rdquo; was all that I could
hear coming out of him. All this time we in the
dory were coming on behind, Clancy and I having
to beat their dory just as our boat had to
beat their boat. And we were driving, too, you
may be sure. Clancy was making his oars bend
like whips. &ldquo;Blast &rsquo;em! There&rsquo;s no stiffness to
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; he was complaining. And then, &ldquo;Sock it to
her,&rdquo; he would call out to our fellows in the seine-boat.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the porgy crew licked&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
the stuff,&rdquo; came from the skipper. From on top of
the seine he was watching the fish, watching the
gang, watching the other boats, watching us in
the dory&ndash;&ndash;watching everything. Whoever made
a slip then would hear from it afterwards, we
knew. And clip, clip, clip it was, with the swash
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
just curling nicely under the bow of the other
boat, and I suppose our own, too, if we could
have seen.</p>
<p>Our boat was gaining on the Aurora&rsquo;s and the
skipper was warming up. The fish was going the
same way we were, still a quarter of a mile ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive her,&rdquo; said the skipper. &ldquo;Drive her&ndash;&ndash;drive
her&ndash;&ndash;another length and you got &rsquo;em. And,
Kenney, it&rsquo;s the best of ash you&rsquo;ve got. Don&rsquo;t be
afraid of breaking it. And, Dan Burns, didn&rsquo;t
y&rsquo;ever learn to keep stroke in the Bay of Islands
with nine more men beside you rowing? And
drive her&ndash;&ndash;hit her up now&ndash;&ndash;here&rsquo;s where we got
&rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;they can&rsquo;t hold it on their lives. Now then,
another dozen strokes and it&rsquo;s over. One, two,
three&ndash;&ndash;quicker, Lord, quicker&ndash;&ndash;six, seven&ndash;&ndash;oh,
now she&rsquo;s fair flying&ndash;&ndash;look at her leap. You
blessed lobster, keep rowing and not looking over
your shoulder. We got to get the fish first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quarter mile of that with the foam ripping
by us, and every man with his blood like fire
jumping to his oar, when the skipper leaped back
to the steering oar. &ldquo;Stand by,&rdquo; he called, and
then, &ldquo;Now&ndash;&ndash;over with the buoy,&rdquo; and over it
went, with the dory at hand and Tommie Clancy
right there to pick it up and hold it to windward.
And then went the seine over in huge armfuls.
Just to see Long Steve throw that seine was worth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
a trip South. And he was vain as a child of his
strength and endurance. &ldquo;My, but look at him!&rdquo;
Clancy called out&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;look at the back of him!&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a horse,&rdquo; somebody else would have to
say, and &ldquo;H-g-gh,&rdquo; Steve would grunt, and
&ldquo;H-g-gh&rdquo; he would fill the air full of tarred netting,
&ldquo;H-g-gh&ndash;&ndash;pass them corks,&rdquo; and over it
would go, &ldquo;H-g-gh,&rdquo; and the skipper would say,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy, Steve,&rdquo; and Steve would heave
to break his back right then and there. All the
time they were driving the seine-boat to its limit,
and the skipper was laying to the big steering oar,
the longest of them all and taking a strong man
to handle it properly&ndash;&ndash;laying to it, swinging from
the waist like a hammer-thrower, and the boat
jumping to it. She came jumping right for us in
the dory in a little while. It doesn&rsquo;t take a good
gang long to put a quarter mile of netting around
a school of mackerel.</p>
<p>It was a pretty set he made. &ldquo;Pretty, pretty,&rdquo;
you could almost hear the old seiners saying between
their teeth, even as they were all rowing
with jaws set and never a let-up until the circle
was completed, when it was oars into the air and
Clancy leaping from the dory into the seine-boat
to help purse up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a raft if ever we get &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
were his first words, and everybody that wasn&rsquo;t
too breathless said yes, it was a jeesly raft of fish.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Purse in,&rdquo; it was then, and lively. And so we
pursed in, hauling on the running line in the lower
edge of the seine, something as the string around
the neck of a tobacco bag is drawn tight. It was
heavy work of course, but everybody made light
of it. We could not tell if the fish were in it or
not. The leaders might have dove when they felt
the twine against their noses and so escaped with
the whole school following after, or they might
have taken no alarm and stayed in.</p>
<p>So we pursed in, not knowing whether we were
to have a good haul with a hundred or a hundred
and fifty dollars apiece at the end of it, or whether
we would have our work for nothing. All hands
kept up the pretence of joking, of course, but everybody
was anxious enough. It was more than the
money&ndash;&ndash;it was fisherman&rsquo;s pride. Were we to get
into New York and have it telegraphed on to
Gloucester for everybody that knew us to read and
talk about&ndash;&ndash;landing the first mackerel of the
year? We watched while the circle narrowed and
the pool inside grew shallower. Somebody said,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; and we could see the shine of it,
and another&ndash;&ndash;and another&ndash;&ndash;and then the whole
mass of them rose flipping. They lashed the water
into foam, rushed around the edges, nosed the
corks of the seine. I don&rsquo;t think myself that
mackerel are particularly intelligent, take them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
generally; but at times they seem to know&ndash;&ndash;these
fellows, at least, seemed to know they were gone
and they thrashed about in fury. A mackerel is a
handsome fish any time, but to see him right you
want to see him fresh-seined. They whipped the
water white now&ndash;&ndash;tens of thousands of them. I
don&rsquo;t believe that the oldest seiner there didn&rsquo;t feel
his heart beat faster&ndash;&ndash;the first mackerel of the
year. &ldquo;And Lord knows, maybe a couple of hundred
barrels,&rdquo; and the skipper&rsquo;s eyes shone&ndash;&ndash;it
meant a lot to him. And some of the men began
to talk like children, they were so pleased.</p>

<h2>X</h2>
<h3>WE LOSE OUR SEINE</h3>
</div>
<p>Two hundred barrels the skipper had said,
but long before we were all pursed up we
knew that five hundred barrels would never hold
the fish in that seine. The size of that school filled
us with joy and yet it was the very size of it that
caused us our trouble. It was too big for the seine,
and when they began to settle down and take the
twine with them the trouble began for us. No bit
of twine ever made to be handled from a seine-boat
was big enough to hold that school of fish when
they began to go down.</p>
<p>The skipper was awake to it early and signalled
for the vessel to come alongside. So the Johnnie
stood over to us, and Hurd, pushing the spare dory
over with Moore&rsquo;s help, came jumping with it to
the side of the seine where I was alone in the first
dory. He hadn&rsquo;t even stopped to get into his oilskins,
he was in such a hurry. By the skipper&rsquo;s
orders I had made fast some of the corks to the
thwarts in the dory and Billie took some into the
spare dory. The whole length of the seine-boat
they were making fast the seine too. In that way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the skipper hoped to buoy up the fish and hold
them until we could lighten the seine up by bailing
some of the fish onto the deck of the vessel. But
it was of no use. There must have been a thousand
barrels of them, and dories and seine-boat began
to go under. It was over the rail of my dory
and spare dory both, and both Billie and myself
to our waists, when the skipper sung out for us to
jump and save ourselves. We hung on a little
longer, but it got to be too much for us and overboard
we went. We were not in danger then. It
is true that the sea was making and we were
weighted down with oilskins and rubber boots, but
we had for support the corks that had not yet
gone under. And along the corks we hauled ourselves
toward the seine-boat. I was praying that
the sharks that sometimes follow up mackerel
would not bother us. It is probable that they
would not even if there were any around, as mackerel
are better eating. And such a fuss as we made
hauling ourselves through the water! We&rsquo;d have
scared away a whole school of sharks. Before we
could get to the seine-boat that, too, was under.
&ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; called the skipper, and &ldquo;Jump everybody!&rdquo;
called Clancy, and themselves both hanging
on to a last handful of twine. The men in the
seine-boat jumped and struck out for the vessel,
which was now quite close, with the cook, the only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
man left aboard, throwing over keelers, draw-buckets,
the main sheet&ndash;&ndash;anything within his reach
that was loose and would support a man.</p>
<p>The skipper and Clancy hung on to the last.
&ldquo;Jump you, Tommie!&rdquo; called the skipper. &ldquo;Not
me till you go,&rdquo; answered Clancy. They couldn&rsquo;t
do a bit of good, but they hung on, each grabbing
handfuls of twine in a last effort to hold up the
seine. The seine-boat went under&ndash;&ndash;and they up
to their necks&ndash;&ndash;and then it turned over and in
toward the seine. Some of us hollered&ndash;&ndash;we were
afraid that it was all up with both of them&ndash;&ndash;that
they would be thrown toward the inside and tangled
up in the seine. But both of them bobbed up,
the skipper saying nothing, but Clancy sputtering
like a crazy man. The dories coming loose gave a
few of us a chance to climb up on the bottom of
them, and when the seine-boat came bobbing up
most of the others climbed up on the bottom of
that. And there was some swearing done then,
you may be sure! The gang would have been all
right then, waiting to be picked up by the cook
from the vessel, which was then pretty handy; but
the seine-boat started to go under again and then
came the slap of a little sea, and overboard went
seven or eight of us. Clancy was one of those
thrown into the water. We all remembered it
afterwards because he called out for Andie Howe.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Andie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Andie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanging onto the bow of the seine-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hang on a while longer,&rdquo; said Clancy and
struck out for the vessel, and made it too, oilskins,
big boots and all. He threw two or three lines
out at once&ndash;&ndash;one especially to Thad Simpson, the
other man of the crew besides Andie Howe who it
was known couldn&rsquo;t swim. So Clancy hauled him
in. The third man he hauled in was Billie Hurd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Tommie,&rdquo; said Billie, &ldquo;you hove
a line over my head to Andie Howe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pop-eyed Spanish mackerel!&rdquo; roared
Clancy at him, &ldquo;you ought to know by this time
that Andie can&rsquo;t swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but he was all oiled up, and look
at me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to hell,&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>We all got aboard after a while, but our fine
new seine was gone, and the big school of fish too.
After a hard grapple we got the dories and a little
later the seine-boat, and after a lot more work we
got them right side up. The dories we pulled the
plugs out of to let them drain and then took
them on deck, but the seine-boat we had to pump
out. By then it was pretty well on in the night
and I remember how the moon rose just as we had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
it fairly well dried out and dropped astern&ndash;&ndash;rose
as big as a barrel-head and threw a yellow light
over it, and then went out of sight, for a breeze
was on us.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Oh, Lord! that thousand-barrel school!&rdquo;
groaned everybody.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>AN OVER-NIGHT BREEZE</h3>
</div>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t bad enough that we came near losing
a few men and our boat, and our seine altogether,
but it must come on to breeze up on top of
that and drive us off the grounds. After putting
everything to rights, we were having a mug-up forward
and wondering if the skipper would take sail
off her or what, when we heard the call that
settled it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On deck everybody!&rdquo; we heard. And when
we got there, came from the skipper, &ldquo;Take in the
balloon, tie it up and put it below. Haul down
your stays&rsquo;l too&ndash;&ndash;and go aloft a couple of you,
fore and aft, and put the tops&rsquo;ls in gaskets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We attended to that&ndash;&ndash;a gang out on the bowsprit,
half a dozen aloft and so on&ndash;&ndash;with the skipper
to the wheel while it was being done. When
we had finished it was, &ldquo;Haul the seine-boat alongside&ndash;&ndash;pump
out what water&rsquo;s left.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;Shift
that painter and hook on the big painter. Drop
her astern and give her plenty of line. Where&rsquo;s
the dorymen? Where&rsquo;s Tommie and Joe? Haul
the dories into the hatch, Tommie, and make &rsquo;em
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
fast. Gripe &rsquo;em good while you&rsquo;re at it. Clear
the deck of all loose gear&ndash;&ndash;put it below, all of it&ndash;&ndash;keelers,
everything. Maybe &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t be much of a
blow, but there&rsquo;s no telling&ndash;&ndash;it may. She mayn&rsquo;t
be the kind that washes everything over, but put
it all safe anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper watched all this until he had seen
everything cleared up and heard &ldquo;All fast the
dory,&rdquo; from the waist. Then he looked up and
took note of sky and wind. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel any too
good. Maybe &rsquo;twill blow off, but we might&rsquo;s well
run in. We&rsquo;ll have to wait for our other seine
anyway and Wesley will be sure to put into the
Breakwater for news on his way down, especially
if it comes to blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped below then to light his pipe. Seeing
me and Parsons, with me trying to fix up Parsons&rsquo;s
leg where it had been gashed&ndash;&ndash;Eddie never
knew how&ndash;&ndash;in the mix-up of the evening, the
skipper said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some liniment in the chest
and some linen in one of the drawers under my
bunk. Get it. And some of you might&rsquo;s well turn
in and have a nap. She&rsquo;ll be all right&ndash;&ndash;the watch
and myself can look after her now,&rdquo; and he went
on deck again, puffing like an engine to keep his
pipe going.</p>
<p>Most of them did turn in and were soon asleep.
Some of the older men had a smoke and an overhauling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
of their wet clothes, while a few joined in a
little game of draw before turning in. One or two
were deploring the loss of the seine. The nearness
to losing lives didn&rsquo;t seem to be worrying
anybody. For myself, I was somewhat worked
up. There was one time in the water when I
thought I was gone. So I went on deck after the
skipper. It was a black night and breezing all
the time and I wanted to see how the vessel behaved.
The Johnnie was close-hauled at this
time and swashing under, and I knew without asking
further that the skipper intended to make
Delaware Breakwater.</p>
<p>While hurrying forward, after lending a hand
to batten down the main hatch&ndash;&ndash;the Johnnie
plunging along all the time&ndash;&ndash;and my head perhaps
a little too high in the air, I stumbled off the
break and plump over a man under the windward
rail. I thought I was going to leeward and maybe
overboard, but somebody hooked onto the full in
the back of my oil-jacket, hauled me up the inclined
deck again, and in a roaring whisper said, &ldquo;Get a
hold here, Joey&ndash;&ndash;here&rsquo;s a ring-bolt for you.
Don&rsquo;t let go on your life! Isn&rsquo;t it fine?&rdquo; It was
Clancy. He had nights, I know, when he couldn&rsquo;t
sleep, and like me, I suppose, he wanted to watch
the sea, which just then was firing grandly. Into
this sea the vessel was diving&ndash;&ndash;nose first&ndash;&ndash;bringing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
her bowsprit down, down, down, and then up,
up, up, until her thirty-seven-foot bowsprit would
be pointing to where the North star should be.
Whenever she heaved like that I could feel her
deck swelling under me. I remember when I used
to play foot-ball at the high school at home and it
was getting handy to a touch-down, with perhaps
only a few yards to gain and the other side braced
to stop it, that a fellow playing back had to buck
like that from under a line when he had to scatter
tons, or what he thought was tons, of people on
top of him. The vessel was that way now, only
with every dive she had hundreds of tons to lift
from under. At a time like that you can feel the
ribs of a vessel brace within her just as if she was
human. Now I could almost feel her heart
pumping and her lungs pounding somewhere inside.
I could feel her brace to meet it, feel her
shiver, as if she was scared half to death, and almost
hear her screech like a winner every time she
cleared it and threw it over her head.</p>
<p>Now down she went&ndash;&ndash;the Johnnie Duncan&ndash;&ndash;down
and forward, for she wouldn&rsquo;t be held back&ndash;&ndash;shoulders
and breast slap into it. Clear to her
waist she went, fighting the sea from her. To
either side were tumbling the broken waves, curling
away like beach combers. The hollow of each was
a curved sheet of electric white, and the top&ndash;&ndash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
crest&ndash;&ndash;was a heavier, hotter white. The crests
would rise above our rail and break, and back into
the hollows would fall a shower of shooting stars
that almost sizzled. There wasn&rsquo;t a star above,
but millions on the water!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see anything like that ashore, Joey-boy?&rdquo;
said Clancy, and I had to roar a whisper that I
never had.</p>
<p>Through this play of fire the Johnnie leaped
with great bounds. She boiled her way, and astern
she left a wake in which the seine-boat was rearing
and diving with a fine little independent trail
of its own.</p>
<p>Two men forward&ndash;&ndash;the watch&ndash;&ndash;were leaning
over the windlass and peering into the night.
They were there for whatever they might see, but
particularly were they looking for the double white
light of Five Fathom Bank lightship. The skipper
was at the wheel. When he got in the way of
the cabin light, we could catch the shine from his
dripping oil-clothes, and the spark from his pipe&ndash;&ndash;which
he kept going through it all&ndash;&ndash;marked his
position when he stepped back into the darkness.</p>
<p>Clancy noticed him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man for you,
Joey. Think what it meant to a young skipper
with a new vessel&ndash;&ndash;the loss of that school and the
seine on top of it the very first day he struck fish.
If we&rsquo;d got that, he might have been the first vessel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
of the year into the New York market. And think
of the price the first fish fetch!&ndash;&ndash;and the honor of
it&ndash;&ndash;and he breaking his heart to make a reputation
this year. And yet not a yip out of him&ndash;&ndash;not a
cranky word to one of the gang all night. A
great man I call him&ndash;&ndash;and a fisherman.&rdquo; I
thought so, too.</p>
<p>Sometimes I imagined I could see the wink of
red and green lights abreast and astern, which I
probably did, for there should have been fifty sail
or so of seiners inside and outside of us&ndash;&ndash;there
were sixty sail of the fleet in sight that afternoon&ndash;&ndash;and
I knew that, barring a possible few that had
got fish and were driving for the New York market,
all the others were like ourselves, under lower
sails and boring into it, with extra lookout forward,
the skipper at the wheel or on the quarter and all
ears and eyes for the surf and lights inshore when
we should get there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something ahead! dead ahead! sa-ail!&rdquo; came
suddenly from forward. There was a scraping
of boot-heels at the wheel. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;y&rsquo;make of
it?&ndash;&ndash;all right, I see her!&rdquo; In the shadow we saw
the skipper pulling the wheel down. Ahead I
imagined I saw a dark patch, but to make sure I
squirmed up to the fore-rigging. Whoever she
was, the light from her cabin skylight was right
there and I realized that we were pretty close, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
not really how close until a boat bobbed up under
my jaws almost. Right from under our bow it
heaved. It was a seiner and that was her seine-boat
towing astern, and I could easily have heaved
a line to her helmsman as we swept by her. There
was an awfully tall shadow of sails&ndash;&ndash;half up to
the clouds I thought&ndash;&ndash;and the black of the hull
looked as long as a dock. A voice was hurled to
us, but we couldn&rsquo;t quite make it out&ndash;&ndash;but it was
the watch, probably, saying a word or two by way
of easing his feelings.</p>
<p>We worked up to the windward of that one and
slowly crowded past her tumbling green light.
Then the skipper let the wheel fly up and we shot
ahead and soon we had her directly astern, with
her one green and one red eye looking after us.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one fellow we outsail,&rdquo; thought I to myself,
and I knew I was beginning to love the
Johnnie Duncan.</p>
<p>All through that night it went on like that.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock or so in the morning the cook
stuck his head out of the slit in the forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le companionway
and spoke his welcome little piece.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have any reg&rsquo;lar sit-down this morning,
boys. Have to leave the china in the becket for
a while yet, but all that wants can make a mug-up,
and when we get inside&ndash;&ndash;if we do in anything like
a decent hour&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll have breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock the sky began to brighten to the
eastward, but there was no let-up to the wind or
sea. If anything it was breezing up. At six
o&rsquo;clock, when the short blasts of the lightship split
the air abreast of us, things were good and lively,
but there was no daylight to go by then. The wash
that in the night only buried her bow good was
then coming over her to the foremast and filling
the gangway between the house and rail as it raced
aft. The beauty of double-lashing the dories began
to appear, and all hands might have been
towing astern all night by the look of them. But
the Johnnie Duncan was doing well and the opinion
of the crew generally was that the skipper
could slap every rag to her and she&rsquo;d carry it&ndash;&ndash;that
is, if she had to. The skipper put her more
westerly after we had passed the lightship and
on we went.</p>
<p>We had the company of a couple of coasters in
this part of the drive; and by that, if nothing else,
a man might know we were inshore. Some
Gloucester men were in sight, too, though most of
the fleet, we guessed, were still outside of us. The
coasters were colliers, three-masters both, and
reefed down, wallowing in the sea. One had her
foretopmast snapped short off, and such patched
sails as she had on looked lonesome. The gang, of
course, had to make fun of her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one way to house a topm&rsquo;st!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broke your clothes-pole, old girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better take in your washing there&ndash;&ndash;looks like
rain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, you beauty! I only wish I had my cameraw.
If y&rsquo;only suspected how lovely you look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two big ocean tugs, one clear white and one all
black, offered a change in looks, though in nothing
else, for each one, with two barges of coal, was
making desperate hauling of it, and the Breakwater
yet a good bit away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hustle &rsquo;em, you husky coal-jammers!&rdquo; roared
Parsons at them, as if he could be heard beyond
the rail. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be aboard of you for my
share of the Southern trip&ndash;&ndash;and mackerel away up
in G, too. Would you, Billie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then? Naw!&rdquo; said Hurd, with a wrinkling
of his little nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor me neither,&rdquo; said Long Steve. &ldquo;Hi&ndash;&ndash;ever
hear the cook&ndash;&ndash;ever hear George Moore&rsquo;s
song:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&lsquo;If ever you go to sea, my boy,</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever you ship on a steamer;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stacks to scrape and rails to paint&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always work to clean her.</p>
<p>When the wind is wrong and the shore is by,</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll keep you clear of leeway,</p>
<p>But they roll and they jolt and they&rsquo;re never dry&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the devil&rsquo;s own in a sea-way!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>Steve, trying to sing that, had one hand hooked
into a ring-bolt under the rail and he was slowly
pickling&ndash;&ndash;we were all pickling&ndash;&ndash;like a salted
mackerel in a barrel.</p>
<p>An hour past Five Fathom and the tall white
tower of Cape Henlopen could be made out ahead,
as well as the gray tower of Cape May through the
mists to the northward. The wind was coming
faster and it felt heavier. We could judge best of
how we were looking ourselves by watching all our
fellows near by. We could see to the bottom
planks of two to leeward of us, while on the sloping
deck of one to windward it was plain that only
what was lashed or bolted was still there. When
they reared they almost stood up straight, and
when they scooped into it the wonder was that all
the water taken aboard didn&rsquo;t hold her until the
next comber could have a fair whack at her.</p>
<p>The men&ndash;&ndash;that is, a few of them&ndash;&ndash;might joke,
but were all glad to be getting in. There&rsquo;s no fun
staying wet and getting wetter all night long. If
it wasn&rsquo;t for the wetness of a fellow it would have
been great, for it was the finest kind of excitement,
our running to harbor&ndash;&ndash;that night&ndash;&ndash;especially
in the morning when we were passing
three or four and nobody passing us. We went
by one fellow&ndash;&ndash;the Martinet she was&ndash;&ndash;a fair
enough sailer&ndash;&ndash;passed her to windward of course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
our gang looking across at their gang and nobody
saying a word, but everybody thinking a lot, you
may be sure. It was worth a square meal that.</p>
<p>With the Martinet astern, the skipper let her
pay off and run for the end of the Breakwater.
For a while he let the wind take her fair abeam,
with sheets in, and the way she sizzled through the
water was a caution. There was a moment that
an extra good blast hit her that my heart sank,
but I reflected that the skipper knew his business,
and so tried to take it unconcernedly. Everybody
around me was joking and laughing&ndash;&ndash;to think, I
suppose, that we would soon be in.</p>
<p>A moment after that I went down to leeward.
The sea was bubbling in over her rail at the fore-rigging
and I wanted to get the feel of it. I got
it. It is pretty shoal water on the bar at the mouth
of the Delaware River and quite a little sea on
when it blows. One sea came aboard. Somebody
yelled and I saw it&ndash;&ndash;but too late&ndash;&ndash;and slap! over
I went&ndash;&ndash;over the rail&ndash;&ndash;big boots and oilskins I
went down into the roaring. For a second my
head came up and I saw the vessel. Everybody
aboard was standing by. The skipper was whirling
the spokes and the vessel was coming around
like a top. I never saw a vessel roll down so
far in all my life. I went under again and coming
up heard a dull shout. There was a line beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
me. &ldquo;Grab hold!&rdquo; yelled somebody. No need
to tell me&ndash;&ndash;I grabbed hold. It was the seine-boat&rsquo;s
painter. The Johnnie was still shooting and
when the line tautened it came as near to pulling
my arms out of my shoulders as ever I want to
have them again. But I hung on. Then she came
up, and they hauled the painter in and gaffed me
over the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You blankety blank fool!&rdquo; roared Clancy, as
soon as I stood up&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know any better?
A fine thing we&rsquo;d have to be telegraphing home,
wouldn&rsquo;t it? Are you all right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said, and felt pretty cheap.</p>
<p>While being hauled in, knowing that I was
safe, I had been thinking what a fine little adventure
I&rsquo;d have to tell when we got back to
Gloucester, but after Clancy got through with me
I saw that there were two ways to look at it. So
I took my old place under the windward rail and
didn&rsquo;t move from there again till it was time to
take sail off her.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>THE FLEET RUNS TO HARBOR</h3>
</div>
<p>Nearing the Breakwater we had more company.
Other seiners, with boats astern and
dories on deck, were coming in; jumbo, jib, fore
and reefed mainsail generally, and all plunging
gloriously with a harbor near at hand.</p>
<p>For the next few hours of that morning any
watcher in the lighthouse on the Breakwater could
have seen plenty of samples of clever seamanship.
At our time we were only one of a half-dozen at
the business of working around the jetty, some
making for one end and some for the other.
There was a great trying of tacks and some plain
criticism of tactics and weatherly qualities. There
was one who tried to cut in before he could quite
make it. When he had to put back or run ashore
and lose her, a great laugh went up, though there
was nothing the matter with the try. He had only
tried too much.</p>
<p>Eddie Parsons was the sharp critic. &ldquo;Trying to
beat out the fleet, hey? And with that old hooker?
Nothing wrong with your nerve, old man, but
some fine day, when there&rsquo;s a little wind stirring,
you&rsquo;ll roll that tub over a little too far. That&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
right&ndash;&ndash;jam her up now! Think you got a steamboat?
Wonder nobody ever told you about sailing
a vessel. Come out of it, old man, and let her
swing off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had yet to get in ourselves, and that we had
the Johnnie Duncan to eat into the wind we were
thankful. At last we were by and reaching down
to the end of the jetty. We all began to feel good
once we were sure of it. It was fine, too, to listen
to Clancy as we got near. He was standing on
the break, leaning against the weather rigging and
looking forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d been coming here for a
hundred years, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Look at her point
her nose now at that beacon&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t have to give
this one the wheel at all. She&rsquo;s the girl. See her
bow off now. Man, but she knows as well as you
and me she&rsquo;ll be inside and snug&rsquo;s a kenched
mackerel before long. Watch her kick into the
wind now. Oh, she&rsquo;s the lady, this one. I&rsquo;ve
sailed many of them, but she&rsquo;s the queen of them
all, this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half dozen of lucky fellows were in before us.
We drove in among them, under the bow of one
and past the stern of another. They were all
watching us, after the custom of the fleet in harbor.
We knew this and behaved as smartly as we could
without slopping over.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>By and by our skipper picked out a place to his
fancy. &ldquo;Stand by halyards and down-hauls,&rdquo; was
his warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready&ndash;&ndash;all ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready with the anchor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready the anchor, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with your jib! Down with jumbo! Let
go your fore halyards! Watch out now&ndash;&ndash;ready&ndash;&ndash;let
go your anchor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rattle&ndash;&ndash;whizz&ndash;&ndash;whir-r-r&ndash;&ndash;splash! clink&ndash;&ndash;and
the Johnnie Duncan of Gloucester was safe to her
mooring.</p>
<p>And not till then did our skipper, ten hours to
the wheel, unclinch his grip, hook the becket to a
spoke, slat his sou&rsquo;wester on the wheel-box and
ease his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord, there&rsquo;s a jeesly blow behind
us. There&rsquo;s some outside&rsquo;ll wish they had a shore
job before they get in. Hi, boys, when you get
her tied up for&rsquo;ard, better all go below and have a
bite to eat. Let the mains&rsquo;l stand and give it a
chance to dry.&rdquo; Then he looked about him.
&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t notice that anybody passed us on
the way.&rdquo; There was a whole lot in that last.</p>
<p>After eating a bite, I went over in the dory to
the lighthouse on the jetty, where seamen&rsquo;s mail
was taken care of. After leaving my letters I
stopped to watch some of the fleet coming. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
easy enough to pick them. The long, slick-looking,
lively seine-boat in tow and the black pile of
netting on deck told what they were, and they came
jumping out of the mists in a way to make a man&rsquo;s
heart beat.</p>
<p>There was a man standing on the jetty. He was
master of a three-masted coaster, he told me.
&ldquo;You come off one of them Gloucester mackerel-catchers?&rdquo;
he asked me. I said yes. &ldquo;That new-looking
one that came in a while ago?&rdquo; I said yes
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was watching her&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s a dream&ndash;&ndash;a dream.
I never see anything like them&ndash;&ndash;the whole bunch
of &rsquo;em. Look at this one&ndash;&ndash;ain&rsquo;t she got on about
all she can stand up under though? My soul,
ain&rsquo;t she staggering! I expect her skipper knows
his business&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t expect he&rsquo;d be skipper of a
fine vessel like that if he didn&rsquo;t. But if &rsquo;twas me
I&rsquo;d just about take a wide tuck or two in that ever-lastin&rsquo;
mains&rsquo;l he&rsquo;s got there. My conscience, but
ain&rsquo;t he a-sockin&rsquo; it to her! I s&rsquo;pose that&rsquo;s the way
some of your vessels are sailed out and never
heard from again&ndash;&ndash;that was never run into, nor
rolled over, nor sunk in a reg&rsquo;lar way, but just
drove right into it head-first trying to make a passage
and drowned before ever they could rise
again. Well, good-luck to you, old girl, and your
skipper, whoever he is, and I guess if your canvas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
stays on you&rsquo;ll be to anchor before a great while,
for you&rsquo;re making steamboat time. Go it, old
girl, and your little baby on behind, go it! There
ain&rsquo;t nothing short of an ocean liner could get you
now. Go it! a sail or two don&rsquo;t matter&ndash;&ndash;if it&rsquo;s a
good mackerel season I s&rsquo;pose the owners don&rsquo;t
mind if you blow away a few sails. Go it, God
bless you! Go it! you&rsquo;re the lads can sail a vessel,
you fishermen of Gloucester. Lord, if I dared to
try a thing like that with my vessel and my crew
and the old gear I got, I rather expect I&rsquo;d have a
rigger&rsquo;s bill by the time I got home&ndash;&ndash;if ever I got
home carryin&rsquo; on like that in my old hooker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I watched her, too. She was the Tarantula, Jim
Porter, another sail-carrier. Around the point and
across she tore and over toward the sands beyond,
swung off on her heel to her skipper&rsquo;s heave, came
down by the wreck of a big three-master on the
inner beach, and around and up opposite what
looked like a building on the hill. Then it was
down with the wheel, down with headsails, let go
fore-halyards, over with the anchor, and there she
was, another fisherman of Gloucester, at rest in
harbor after an all-night fight with a lively breeze.</p>
<p>And I left the master of the coaster there and
went back to the Duncan, where the crew were
standing along the rail or leaning over the house
and having a lot of fun sizing up those who were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
coming in. It is one of the enjoyments of the
seining fleet&ndash;&ndash;this racing to harbor when it blows
and then watching the others work in. I&rsquo;ve heard
it said that no place in the world can show a fleet
like them&ndash;&ndash;all fine vessels, from one hundred to
one hundred and twenty feet over all, deep
draught, heavily sparred, and provided with all
kinds of sail. They were ably managed, of course,&ndash;&ndash;and
a dash to port makes the finest kind of a
regatta. No better chances are offered to try vessels
and seamanship&ndash;&ndash;no drifting or flukes but
wind enough for all hands and on all points of
sailing generally.</p>
<p>They came swooping in one after the other&ndash;&ndash;like
huge sea-gulls, only with wings held close.
Now, with plenty of light, those already in could
easily see the others coming long before they
rounded the jetty. Even if we couldn&rsquo;t see the
hulls of them, there were fellows who could name
them&ndash;&ndash;one vessel after the other&ndash;&ndash;just by the spars
and upper rigging. The cut of a topsail, the look
of a mast-head, the set of a gaff&ndash;&ndash;the smallest
little thing was enough to place them, so well were
they acquainted with one another. And the distance
at which some of them could pick out a
vessel was amazing.</p>
<p>George Moore, coming up out of the forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le
to dump over some scraps, spied one. &ldquo;The Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
Grace Adams,&rdquo; he sang out,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the shortest
forem&rsquo;st out of Gloucester. She must&rsquo;ve been well
inside when she started&ndash;&ndash;to get in at this time.
Slow&ndash;&ndash;man, but she is slow, that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the old girl, and behind her is the
Dreamer&ndash;&ndash;Charlie Green&ndash;&ndash;black mast-heads and
two patches on her jumbo. She&rsquo;ll be in and all fast
before the Mary Grace&rsquo;s straightened out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was&ndash;&ndash;almost. The Mary Adams was
one of the older fleet and never much of a sailer.
The Dreamer was one of the newer vessels, able,
and a big sailer. They were well raked by the
critics, as under their four lowers they whipped in
and around and passed on by.</p>
<p>After the Dreamer came the Madeline, with
&ldquo;Black Jack&rdquo; Hogan, a fleshy man for a fisherman,
who minded his way and remained unmoved
at the compliments paid his vessel, one of the prize
beauties of the fleet. The Marguerite, Charley
Falvey, a dog at seining, always among the
high-liners, who got more fun out of a summer&rsquo;s
seining than most men ever got out of yachting,
who bought all the latest inventions in gear as fast
as they came out and who had a dainty way of
getting fish. The Marguerite dipped her bow as
she passed, while her clever skipper nodded along
the line.</p>
<p>The King Philip, another fast beauty, made her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
bow and dipped her jibs to her mates in harbor.
At sight of her master, Al McNeill, a great shout
goes up. &ldquo;Ho, ho! boys, here&rsquo;s Lucky Al! Whose
seine was it couldn&rsquo;t hold a jeesly big school one
day off here last spring but Billie Simms&rsquo;? Yes,
sir, Billie Simms. Billie fills up and was just about
thinking he&rsquo;d have to let the rest go when who
heaves in sight and rounds to and says, &lsquo;Can I help
y&rsquo;out, William?&rsquo; Who but Lucky Al McNeill,
of course. Bales out two hundred barrels as nice
fat mackerel as anybody&rsquo;d want to see. &lsquo;Just fills
me up,&rsquo; says Al, and scoots to market. Just been
to New York, mind you, that same week with two
hundred and fifty barrels he got twelve cents
apiece for. &lsquo;Just fills me up,&rsquo; says Al, and scoots.
No, he ain&rsquo;t a bit lucky, Captain Al ain&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;married
a young wife only last fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed the Albatross, with Mark
Powers giving the orders. Then the Privateer, another
fast one, but going sluggishly now because of
a stove-in seine-boat wallowing astern. Then the
North Wind, with her decks swept clear of everything
but her house and hatches. Seine-boat, seine
and dory were gone.</p>
<p>After her was a big, powerful vessel, the Ave
Maria, with the most erratic skipper of all. This
man never appeared but the gossip broke out.
Andie Howe had his record. &ldquo;Here comes George
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Ross. What&rsquo;s this they say now?&ndash;&ndash;that he don&rsquo;t
come down from the mast-head now like he used
to, when he strikes a school. When I was with him
he was a pretty lively man comin&rsquo; from aloft&ndash;&ndash;used
to sort of fall down, you know. But now he
comes down gentle-like&ndash;&ndash;slides down the back-stay.
Only trouble now he&rsquo;s got to get new rubber
boots every other trip, &rsquo;count of the creases he
wears in the legs of them sliding down the wire.
I tell you they all lose their nerve as they get
older. There&rsquo;s Billie Simms coming behind him.
He&rsquo;s given up tryin&rsquo; to sail his vessel on the side
and tryin&rsquo; to see how long he c&rsquo;n carry all he c&rsquo;n
pile on. Billie says &rsquo;t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t like when a fellow&rsquo;s
young and ain&rsquo;t got any family. I expect it&rsquo;s about
the same with George since he got married.&rdquo; The
master of the Ave Maria didn&rsquo;t even glance over
as he piloted his vessel along. He very well knew
that we were talking about him.</p>
<p>Pretty soon came one that everybody looked at
doubtfully. She sported a new mainmast and a
new fore-gaff. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this old hooker with her
new spars? Looks like a vessel just home from salt
fishing, don&rsquo;t she? Lord, but she needs painting.&rdquo;
Nobody seemed to know who she was, and as she
got nearer there was a straining of eyes for her
name forward. &ldquo;The H-A-R-B-I&ndash;&ndash;oh, the Harbinger.
Must be old Marks and the old craft he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
bought down East last fall. This the old man,
of course&ndash;&ndash;the Harbinger. How long&rsquo;s she been
down here? Came down ahead of the fleet?
Well, she ought to&ndash;&ndash;by the looks of her she needs
a good early start to get anywhere. They ought
to be glad to get in. I mind that September breeze
twenty year ago that the old man said blew all the
water off Quero and drove him ashore on Sable
Island. He says he ain&rsquo;t taking any more line
storms in his. No, nor anybody else in the old
square-enders he gen&rsquo;rally sails in. I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s
glad to change winter trawling for summer seining.
I&rsquo;ll bet he put in a few wakeful nights on
the Banks in his time&ndash;&ndash;mind the time he parted
his cable and came bumping over Sable Island
No&rsquo;the-east Bar? Found the only channel there
was, I callate. &lsquo;Special little angels was looking
out for me,&rsquo; he says, when he got home. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
says Wesley Marrs&ndash;&ndash;he was telling it to Wesley&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;yes,&rsquo;
says Wesley, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll bet keepin&rsquo; the lead
goin&rsquo; had a hell of a lot to do with it, too.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they came rolling in by the end of the jetty
until they could make one last tack of it. Like
tumbling dolphins they were&ndash;&ndash;seiners all, with a
single boat towing astern and a single dory, or
sometimes two dories, lashed in the waist, all gear
stowed away, under four lower sails mostly&ndash;&ndash;jumbo,
jib, fore and main, though now and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
was one with a mainsail in stops and a trysail laced
to the gaff, and all laying down to it until their
rails were washing under and the sea hissed over
the bows.</p>
<p>Anybody would have to admire them as they
came scooting past. When they thought they were
close enough to the Breakwater&ndash;&ndash;and some went
pretty close&ndash;&ndash;up or down would go the wheel,
according to which end of the jetty they came in
by, around they would go, and across the flats and
down on the fleet they would come shooting. They
breasted into the hollows like any sea-bird and
lifted with every heave to shake the water from
bilge to quarter. They came across with never a
let-up, shaving everything along the way until a
good berth was picked out. Then they let go sails,
dropped anchor and were ready for a rest.</p>
<p>Nobody got by our fellows without a word.
And we weren&rsquo;t the only crew of critics. Bungling
seamanship would get a slashing here, but there
was none of that. It was all good, but there are
degrees of goodness, of course. First-class seamanship
being a matter of course, only a wonderful
exhibition won approval from everybody. And
crews coming in, knowing what was ahead of
them, made no mistakes in that harbor.</p>
<p>A dozen ordinary skippers sailed past before a
famous fisherman at length came in. Everybody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
knew him&ndash;&ndash;a dog, a high-liner, truly a master
mariner. A murmur went up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the boy,&rdquo;
said Tommie Clancy. &ldquo;I mind last summer when
he came into Souris just such a day as this, but
with more wind stirring. &rsquo;Twas Fourth of July
and we had all our flags to the peak&ndash;&ndash;and some
fine patriotic fights going on ashore that day&ndash;&ndash;our
flag and the English. The harbor was jammed
with seiners and fresh-fishers. You couldn&rsquo;t see
room for a dory, looking at &rsquo;em end on. But that
don&rsquo;t jar Tom O&rsquo;Donnell. What does he do? He
just comes in and sails around the fleet like a cup-defender
on parade&ndash;&ndash;and every bit of canvas he
had aboard flying&ndash;&ndash;only his crew had to hang
onto the ring-bolts under the wind&rsquo;ard rail. Well,
he comes piling in, looks the fleet over, sizes up
everything, picks out a nice spot as he shoots
around, sails out the harbor again&ndash;&ndash;clean out, yes
sir, clean out&ndash;&ndash;comes about&ndash;&ndash;and it blowing a living
gale all the time&ndash;&ndash;shoots her in again, dives
across a line of us, and fetches her up standing.
We could&rsquo;ve jumped from our rail to his in jack-boots,
he was that close to us and another fellow
the other side. Slid her in like you slide the cover
into a diddy box. Yes, sir, and that&rsquo;s the same
lad you see coming along now&ndash;&ndash;Tom O&rsquo;Donnell
and his Colleen Bawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He certainly was coming on now, and a fine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
working vessel he had. She showed it in every
move. She came around like a twin-screw launch,
picked out her berth like she had intelligence in her
eyes, made for it, swirled, fluttered like a bird, felt
with her claws for the ground underneath, found
it, gripped it, swayed, hung on, and at last settled
gently in her place. There was no more jar to the
whole thing than if she had been a cat-boat in a
summer breeze. &ldquo;Pretty, pretty, pretty,&rdquo; you
could hear the gang along our rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talk about knockabout racing craft,&rdquo; said
Clancy, &ldquo;but did y&rsquo;ever see anything drop to a
berth slicker than that? And that&rsquo;s a vessel you c&rsquo;n
go to sea in, and in the hardest winter gale that
ever blew you c&rsquo;n turn in when your watch is done
and have a feeling of comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the steam trawler, the porgy boat, we
saw yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put into Chincoteague most likely&ndash;&ndash;nearer
than here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll have to come to yet&ndash;&ndash;steamers,
and go on wages like a waiter in a hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clancy, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so, but with vessels
like we got and the seamen sailing out of
Gloucester we&rsquo;ll stave &rsquo;em off a long time yet, and
even as it is, give me a breeze and a vessel like this
one under us and we&rsquo;ll beat out all the steam fishermen
that ever turned a screw.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>One of the latest experiments in a fishermen&rsquo;s
model reached in then and her coming started a
chorus. They were always trying new models in
Gloucester, everybody was so anxious to have a
winner. This one&rsquo;s sails were still white and
pretty and her hull still shiny in fresh black paint.
The red stripe along her rail and the gold stripe
along her run set off her lines; her gear didn&rsquo;t have
a speck on it, her spars were yellow as could be
and to leeward we thought we could still smell the
patent varnish. For that matter there were several
there as new-looking as she was, our own vessel
for one; but there had been a lot of talk about
this one. She was going to clean out the fleet. She
had been pretending to a lot, and as she hadn&rsquo;t yet
made good, of course she got a great raking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s here at last, boys&ndash;&ndash;the yacht, the wonderful,
marvellous Victory! Ain&rsquo;t she a bird? Built
to beat the fleet! Look at the knockabout bow of
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knockabout googleums&ndash;&ndash;h-yah! Scoop shovel
snout and a stern ugly as a battle-ship&rsquo;s, and the
Lord knows there was overhang and to spare
to tail her out decent. Cut out the yellow and the
red and the whole lot of gold decorations and
she&rsquo;s as homely as a Newf&rsquo;undland jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, she c&rsquo;n sail,&rdquo; said somebody
who wanted to start an argument.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sail! Yah! might beat a Rockport granite
sloop. Ever hear of the Henry Clay Parker,
Mister Billie Simms, and the little licking she
gave this winner of yours? No? Well, you want
to go around and have a drink or two with the boys
next time you&rsquo;re ashore and get the news. It was
like a dogfish and a mackerel&ndash;&ndash;the Henry just eat
her up. And there&rsquo;s the others. Why, this one
underneath us&rsquo;d make a holy show of her, I&rsquo;ll bet.
And there&rsquo;s half a dozen others. There&rsquo;s the&ndash;&ndash;oh,
what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Eddie Parsons, a perfect lady and coming
in like a high-stepper and yet you must malign her
beauty and make light of her virtue,&rdquo; and Clancy
jammed Parsons&rsquo;s sou&rsquo;wester down over his eyes&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;hush
up, Eddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the harbor and after the Victory heaved
another one. And she was the real thing&ndash;&ndash;handsome,
fast and able. And she had a record for
bringing the fish home&ndash;&ndash;an able vessel and well-known
for it. She could carry whole sails when
some of the others were double-reefed and thinking
of dragging trysails out of the hold. And her
skipper was a wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You c&rsquo;n cut all the others out&ndash;&ndash;here comes the
real thing. Here&rsquo;s the old dog himself. Did he
ever miss a blow? And look at him. Every man
comes in here to-day under four lowers, no more,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
and some under reefed mains&rsquo;l, or trys&rsquo;l, but four
whole lowers ain&rsquo;t enough for this gentleman&ndash;&ndash;not
for Wesley. He must carry that gaff-tops&rsquo;l if he
pulls the planks out of her. He always brings
her home, but if some of the underwriters&rsquo;d see
him out here they&rsquo;d soon blacklist him till he
mended his ways. It&rsquo;s a blessed wonder he ain&rsquo;t
found bottom before this. Look at her now skating
on her ear. There she goes&ndash;&ndash;if they&rsquo;d just
lower a man over the weather rail with a line on
him he could write his name on her keel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she certainly was something to make a
man&rsquo;s eyes stick out. There had been a vessel or
two that staggered before, but the Lucy fairly
rolled down into it, and there was no earthly reason
why she should do it except that it pleased her
skipper to sport that extra kite.</p>
<p>She boiled up from the end of the jetty, and her
wake was the wake of a screw steamer. She had
come from home, we knew, and so it happened
she was one of the last to get in. The harbor was
crowded as she straightened out. We knew she
would not have too much leeway coming on, and
what berth she was after kept everybody guessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she goes where&rsquo;s she pointing&ndash;&ndash;and most
vessels do&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;ll find a berth down on the beach
on that course, down about where the wreck is.
It&rsquo;ll be dry enough walking when she gets there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
If she keeps on the gait she&rsquo;s going now, she ought
to be able to fetch good and high and dry up on
the mud. They&rsquo;d cert&rsquo;nly be able to step ashore&ndash;&ndash;when
they get there. Ah-h-h, but that&rsquo;s more
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was taking it over the quarter then. She
cleared the stern of the most leeward of the fleet
and then kicked off, heading over to where the
Johnnie Duncan and the Victory lay. The betting
was that she would round to and drop in between
us two. There was room there, but only just room.
It would be a close fit, but there was room.</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t round to. She held straight on
without the sign of a swerve. On the Johnnie, the
gang being almost in her path picked out a course
for her. Between the outer end of our seine-boat
and the end of the bowsprit of the Mary Grace
Adams was a passage that may have been the
width of a vessel. But the space seemed too narrow.
Our crew were wondering if he would try
it. Even the skipper, standing in the companionway,
stepped up on deck to have a better look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to take it quarterin&rsquo;, and it ain&rsquo;t wide
enough,&rdquo; said Eddie Parsons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quartering&ndash;&ndash;yes, but with everything hauled
inboard,&rdquo; said the skipper. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll try it, I guess.
I was with him for two years, and if he feels like
trying it he&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And s&rsquo;pose he does try it, Skipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll come pretty near making it, though
he stands a good chance to scrape the paint off our
seine-boat going by. No, don&rsquo;t touch the seine-boat&ndash;&ndash;let
her be as she is. We&rsquo;ll fool &rsquo;em if they
think they c&rsquo;n jar anybody here coming on like
that. There&rsquo;s room enough if nothing slips, and
if they hit it&rsquo;s their lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It looked like a narrow space for a vessel of her
beam to go through, but she hopped along, and
the eyes of all the harbor followed her to the
point where she must turn tail or make the passage.</p>
<p>She held on&ndash;&ndash;her chance to go back was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch her, boys. Now she&rsquo;s whooping&ndash;&ndash;look
at her come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she was coming. Her windward side was
lifted so high that her bottom planks could be
seen. Her oil-skinned crew were crowded forward.
There were men at the fore-halyards, at
jib-halyards, at the down-hauls, and a group were
standing by the anchor. Two men were at the
wheel.</p>
<p>She bit into it. There was froth at her mouth.
She was so near now that we could read the faces
of her crew; and wide awake to this fine seamanship
we all leaned over the rail, the better to see
how she&rsquo;d make out. The crews of half the vessels
inside the Breakwater were watching her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>She was a length away and jumping to it. It
was yet in doubt, but she was certainly rushing to
some sort of a finish. She rushed on, and w-r-r-rp!
her weather bow came down on the Johnnie&rsquo;s
seine-boat. But it didn&rsquo;t quite hit it. Her quarter
to leeward just cut under the Adams&rsquo; bowsprit and
the leech of her mainsail seemed to flatten past.
For a moment we were not certain, but no jolt or
lurch came and our seine-boat seemed all right.
Another jump and she was clear by. And then we
felt like cheering her, and her skipper Wesley
Marrs, too, as he stood to the wheel and sung out,
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t scare you, could I, Maurice. I thought
you&rsquo;d haul your seine-boat in. I&rsquo;ve got your extra
seine,&rdquo; and swept by.</p>
<p>From our deck and from the deck of the Adams,
and from the decks of half a dozen others, could
be heard murmurs, and there was a general pointing
out of the redoubtable skipper himself to the
green hands that knew him only by reputation.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, Wesley himself&ndash;&ndash;the stocky little
man of the two at the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the stocky little man heard the hails that
were sent after him, he made no sign, unless a
faint dipping of his sou&rsquo;wester back over his windward
shoulder was his way of showing it.</p>
<p>He had business yet, had Wesley Marrs. There
was a tug and a barge and another big seiner in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
his course. He clipped the tug, scraped the barge,
and set the seiner&rsquo;s boat a-dancing, and two lengths
more he put down the wheel and threw her gracefully
into the wind. Down came jib, down came
jumbo, over splashed the anchor. She ran forward
a little, rattled back a link or two, steadied
herself, and there she was. Her big mainsail was
yet shaking in the wind, her gaff-topsail yet fluttering
aloft, but she herself, the Lucy Foster of
Gloucester, was at your service. &ldquo;And what do
you think of her, people?&rdquo; might just as well have
been shot off her deck through a megaphone, for
that was what her bearing and the unnatural
smartness of her crew plainly were saying.</p>
<p>We all drew breath again. Clancy unbent from
the rail and shook his head in high approval. He
took off his sou&rsquo;wester, slatted it over the after-bitt
to clear the brim of water, and spoke his mind.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see nothing cleaner than that in this harbor
to-day, fellows, and you&rsquo;ll see some pretty fair
work at that. That fellow&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s an able seaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;an able seaman,&rdquo; said the skipper
also.</p>
<p>And Clancy and the skipper were something in
the line of able seamen themselves.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>WESLEY MARRS BRINGS A MESSAGE</h3>
</div>
<p>Generally a day in harbor is a day of
loafing for the crew of a seiner; but it was
not so altogether with us that day. Within two
hours of the time that Wesley Marrs came in to
the Breakwater in such slashing style the skipper
had us into the seine-boat and on the way to the
Lucy Foster. By his orders we took along ten
empty mackerel barrels. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go over to the
beach first and fill these barrels up with sand.&rdquo;
We all knew what the sand was for&ndash;&ndash;the Johnnie
Duncan was going to be put in trim to do her best
sailing. Coming down the coast the skipper and
Clancy decided that she was down by the stern
a trifle.</p>
<p>So we attended to the sand, and on the way back
hauled our second seine out of the hold of the Lucy
Foster, and piled it into the seine-boat. With the
last of the twine into the seine-boat and just as we
were about to push off from the Lucy, Wesley
Marrs put a foot on the rail of his vessel and
spoke to Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I was taking the last of that aboard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
in the dock in Gloucester, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe
who it was stepped onto the cap-log and looking
down on the deck of the Lucy says, &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll
take good care of that seine for Captain Blake,
won&rsquo;t you, Captain Marrs?&rsquo; Could you guess
now, Maurice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll bet you can&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t often she comes
down the dock. Miss Foster no less. &lsquo;And what
makes you think I won&rsquo;t?&rsquo; I asks her. &lsquo;Oh, of
course I know you will,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and deliver it
to him in good order, too.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rsquo; I says, as
though it was a desp&rsquo;rate job I had on hand&ndash;&ndash;to
put a seine in the hold and turn it over to another
vessel when I met her. &lsquo;But what makes you worry
about this partic&rsquo;lar seine, Miss Foster?&rsquo; I asks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which Miss Foster was it, Wesley&ndash;&ndash;the one
your vessel is named after?&rdquo; broke in our skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;but the younger one&ndash;&ndash;Alice. &lsquo;But
what makes you worry?&rsquo; I asks her, and she didn&rsquo;t
say anything, but that one that&rsquo;s with her all the
time&ndash;&ndash;the one that goes with the lad that designed
the Johnnie Duncan&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s cousin here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&ndash;&ndash;the fat little Buckley girl&ndash;&ndash;a fine
girl too. And if I was a younger man and looking
for a wife, there&rsquo;s the kind for me&ndash;&ndash;but anyway
she up and says, &lsquo;Alice is worried, Captain Marrs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
because she owns a third of Captain Blake&rsquo;s vessel&ndash;&ndash;a
good part of her little fortune&rsquo;s in the Duncan&ndash;&ndash;and
if anything happens to the seine one-third
of it, of course, comes out of her. And it cost a
good many hundred dollars. So you must be careful.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;ll be shortened
sail and extra careful watches on the Lucy
till I meet Maurice, for I mustn&rsquo;t lose any property
of Miss Foster&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rowed away from the Lucy Foster, and I
supposed that was the end of it. But that night
going on deck to take a last look at the stars before
turning in, there was the skipper and Clancy walking
the break and talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you know, Tommie, that Miss Foster
owned any of this one?&rdquo; the skipper was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tommie, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you suspected. Well, I didn&rsquo;t even suspect.
And there&rsquo;s that seine we lost last night&ndash;&ndash;cost all
of eight hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it did&ndash;&ndash;a fine seine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the skipper went below,
and Clancy, seeing me, said, &ldquo;Hold on, Joey. Did
you hear what the skipper said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Miss Foster owning a share of the
vessel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not that so much, but about the loss of
the seine?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Joe, but sometimes a man would think
you were about ten year old. I tell you, Joe, I&rsquo;m
not too sure it&rsquo;s going to be Withrow. And if you
don&rsquo;t see some driving on this one when next we
get among the fish, then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t finish
it, only clucked his tongue and went below.</p>
<p>Clancy was right again. During the night the
weather moderated, and in the morning the first
of the fleet to go out past the Breakwater was the
Johnnie Duncan. It looked to us as if the skipper
thought the mackerel would be all gone out of the
sea before we got back to the spot where we had
struck them two days before.</p>

<a name='XIV_A_PROSPECT_OF_NIGHTSEINING' id='XIV_A_PROSPECT_OF_NIGHTSEINING'></a>
<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>A PROSPECT OF NIGHT-SEINING</h3>
</div>
<p>We might have stayed in harbor another
twenty-four hours and lost nothing by it.
It was dawn when we put out from the Delaware
Breakwater, and by dark of the same day we were
back to where we had met the big school and lost
the seine two days before. And there we hung
about for another night and day waiting for the sea
to flatten out. Mackerel rarely show in rough
weather, even if you could put out a seine-boat and
go after them. But I suppose that it did us no
harm to be on the ground and ready.</p>
<p>On the evening of the next day there was something
doing. There was still some sea on, but not
enough to hurt. Along about eight o&rsquo;clock, I remember,
I came off watch and dropped into the
forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le to fix up my arm, which was still badly
strained from hanging onto the seine-boat&rsquo;s painter
when I was washed overboard. The skipper, taking
a look, told me not to go into the dory that
night, but to let Billie Hurd, who was spare hand,
take my place, and for me to stay aboard. I would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
rather have gone into the dory, of course, but was
not able to pull an oar&ndash;&ndash;that is, pull it as I&rsquo;d have
to pull when driving for a school&ndash;&ndash;and knowing I
would be no more than so much freight in the
dory there was nothing else to do. &ldquo;And if we see
fish, Clancy&rsquo;ll stay to the mast-head to-night&ndash;&ndash;as
good a seine-master as sails out of Gloucester is
Tommie&ndash;&ndash;better than me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
in the seine-boat, and Eddie Parsons, you&rsquo;ll take
Clancy&rsquo;s place in the dory.&rdquo; And buttoning his
oil-jacket up tight, he put on his mitts and went
on deck.</p>
<p>That evening the forward gang were doing
about as much work as seiners at leisure usually do.
It was in the air that we would strike fish, but the
men had not yet been told to get ready. So four of
them were playing whist at the table under the
lamp and two were lying half in and half out of
opposite upper bunks, trying to get more of the
light on the pages of the books they were reading.
Long Steve, in a lower port bunk nearer the
gangway, was humming something sentimental,
and two were in a knot on the lockers, arguing
fiercely over nothing in particular. There was a
fellow in the peak roaring out, &ldquo;Scots wha hae wi&rsquo;
Wallace bled.&rdquo; Only the cook, just done with
mixing bread, seemed to have ever done a lick of
work in his life, and he was now standing by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
galley fire rolling the dough off his fingers. The
cook on a fisherman is always a busy man.</p>
<p>Down the companionway and into the thick of
this dropped Clancy, oiled up and all ready to go
aloft. To the mast-head of a vessel, even on an
April night in southern waters, it is cold enough,
especially when, like a seiner, she is nearly always
by the wind; and Clancy was wrapped up. &ldquo;I
think,&rdquo; said Clancy, as his boot-heels hit the floor,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a mug-up.&rdquo; From the boiler on the galley-stove
he poured out a mug of coffee and from
the grub-locker he took a slice of bread and two
thick slices of cold beef. He buried the bread
among the beef and leaned against the foremast
while he ate.</p>
<p>Once when Clancy was a skipper he did a fine
bit of rescuing out to sea, and after he got home a
newspaper man saw him and wrote him up. I had
the clipping stuck on the wall of Withrow&rsquo;s store
for months and had read it so often that I knew it
by heart. &ldquo;In heavy jack-boots and summer sou&rsquo;wester,
with a black jersey of fine quality sticking
up above the neck of his oil-jacket, with a face that
won you at sight; cheeks a nice even pink; damp,
storm-beaten, and healthful; with mouth, eyes, and
jaw bespeaking humor, sympathy, and courage;
shoulders that seemed made for butting to windward&ndash;&ndash;an
attractive, inspiring, magnetic man altogether&ndash;&ndash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
is Captain Tommie Clancy of the
Gloucester fisherman, the Mary Andrews.&rdquo; That,
was how it read, and certainly it fitted him now, as
he stood there in the middle of the thick curling
smoke of the pipes, holding the mug of coffee in
one hand and the sandwich of bread and meat in
the other, leaning easily against the butt of the
foremast, and between gulps and bites taking notice
of the crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me,&rdquo; he said to the cook as the proper
man for an audience, &ldquo;a seiner&rsquo;s crew when they&rsquo;re
not on fish for real gentlemen of leisure. Look at
&rsquo;em now&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;d think they were all near-sighted,
with their cards up to their chins. And above them
look&ndash;&ndash;Kipling to starb&rsquo;d and the Duchess to port.
Mulvaney, I&rsquo;ll bet, filled full of whiskey and keeping
the heathen on the jump, and Airy Fairy Lillian,
or some other daisy with winning ways, disturbing
the peace of mind of half a dozen dukes.
Mulvaney&rsquo;s all right, but the Duchess! They&rsquo;ll
be taking books of that kind to the mast-head next.
What d&rsquo;y&rsquo; s&rsquo;pose I found aft the other day? Now
what d&rsquo;y&rsquo; s&rsquo;pose? I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;d never guess. No,
no. Well, &lsquo;He Loved, but Was Lured Away.&rsquo;
Yes. Isn&rsquo;t that fine stuff for a fisherman to be
feeding on? But whoever was reading it, he was
ashamed of it. &lsquo;Well, who owns this thing?&rsquo; says
I, picking up the lured-away lad. &lsquo;Nobody,&rsquo; speaks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
up Sam there. Of course he didn&rsquo;t own it&ndash;&ndash;O no!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violet Vance,&rdquo; went on Clancy, and took another
bite of his sandwich. &ldquo;Violet Vance and
Wilful Winnie and a whole holdful of airy creatures
couldn&rsquo;t help a fisherman when there&rsquo;s anything
stirring. I waded through a whole bunch of
&rsquo;em once,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he reached over and took a wedge
of pie from the grub-locker. &ldquo;Yes, I went through
a whole bunch of &rsquo;em once&ndash;&ndash;pretty good pie this,
cook, though gen&rsquo;rally those artificial apples that
swings on strings ain&rsquo;t in it with the natural tree
apples for pie&ndash;&ndash;once when we were laying somewhere
to the east&rsquo;ard of Sable Island, in a blow
and a thick fog&ndash;&ndash;fresh halibuting&ndash;&ndash;and right in
the way of the liners. And I expect I was going
around like a man asleep, because the skipper
comes up and begins to talk to me. It was my
first trip with him and I was a young lad. &lsquo;Young
fellow,&rsquo; says the skipper, Matt Dawson&ndash;&ndash;this was
in the Lorelei&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;young fellow,&rsquo; says Matt, &lsquo;you
look tired. Let me call up the crew and swing a
hammock for you from the fore-rigging to the
jumbo boom. How&rsquo;ll that do for you? When the
jumbo slats it&rsquo;ll keep the hammock rocking. Let
me,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps,&rsquo; he goes on, &lsquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t
mind waking up long enough to give this music
box a turn or two every now and then while the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
fog lasts.&rsquo; We had a patent fog-horn aboard, the
first I ever saw, and I&rsquo;d clear forgot it&ndash;&ndash;warn&rsquo;t
used to patent horns. But just another little
wedge of pie, George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I suppose when there&rsquo;s nothing doing
there&rsquo;s no very great harm. But we&rsquo;ll try to
keep some of you busy to-night. Praise the Lord,
the moon&rsquo;s out of the way and it&rsquo;s looking black
already and the sea ought to fire up fine later on.
And there&rsquo;s a nice little breeze to overhaul a good
school when we see one. If any of you are beginning
to think of getting in a wink of sleep then
you&rsquo;d better turn in now, for you&rsquo;re sure to be out
before long. I&rsquo;m going aloft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy climbed up the companionway. Then
followed the scraping of his boot-heels across the
deck. Half a minute later, had anybody cared to
go up and have a look, I suppose he would have
been discovered astraddle of the highest block
above the forethroat&ndash;&ndash;he and the skipper&ndash;&ndash;watching
out sharply for the lights of the many other
vessels about them, but more particularly straining
their eyes for the phosphorescent trails of mackerel.</p>

<h3>CLANCY TO THE MAST-HEAD</h3>
</div>
<p>The men below knew their skipper and
Clancy too well to imagine that they were
to be too long left in peace. And then, too, the
next man off watch reported a proper night for
mackerel. &ldquo;Not a blessed star out&ndash;&ndash;and black!
It&rsquo;s like digging a hole in the ground and looking
into it. And the skipper&rsquo;s getting nervous, I know.
I could hear him stirrin&rsquo; &rsquo;round up there when I
was for&rsquo;ard just now, and he hollered to the wheel
that up to the no&rsquo;the&rsquo;ard it looked like planty of
fish. &lsquo;And I callate we ain&rsquo;t the only vessel got
eyes for it,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his watch-mate, who had just
dropped down, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing but side-lights all
&rsquo;round and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then came the skipper&rsquo;s voice from aloft.
&ldquo;Tell the boys they might&rsquo;s well oil up and be
ready.&rdquo; The watch did not have to repeat it&ndash;&ndash;we
all heard it below, and fore and aft, in cabin
and forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le, the gang made ready. Cards, novels,
and all the hot arguments went by the board,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
and then after a mug-up for nearly all we slid into
oil-clothes, boots and sou&rsquo;westers, and puffing at
what was probably to be the last pipeful of the
evening, we lay around on lockers and on the floor,
backs to the butt of the mast and backs to the
stove&ndash;&ndash;wherever there was space for a broad back
and a pair of stout legs our fellows dropped
themselves, discussing all the while the things that
interested them&ndash;&ndash;fish, fishing, fast vessels, big
shares, politics, Bob Fitzsimmons, John L. Sullivan,
good stories, and just then particularly, because
two of the crew were thinking of marrying,
the awful price of real estate in Gloucester.</p>
<p>By and by, ringing as clear as if he himself
stood at the companionway, came the skipper&rsquo;s
voice from the mast-head: &ldquo;On deck everybody!&rdquo;
No more discussion, no more loafing&ndash;&ndash;pipes were
smothered into bosoms, and up the companionway
crowded oilskins and jack-boots.</p>
<p>Then came: &ldquo;It looks like fish ahead of us.
Haul the boat alongside and drop the dory over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We jumped. Four laid hands on the dory in
the waist and ten or a dozen heaved away on the
stiff painter of the seine-boat that was towing
astern. Into the air and over the starboard rail
went the dory, while ploughing up to the vessel&rsquo;s
boom at the port fore-rigging came the bow of the
seine-boat.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>Then followed: &ldquo;Put the tops&rsquo;ls to her&ndash;&ndash;sharp
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The halyards could be heard whirring up toward
the sky, while two bunches of us sagged and
lifted on the deck below. Among us it was, &ldquo;Now
then&ndash;&ndash;o-ho&ndash;&ndash;sway away&ndash;&ndash;good,&rdquo; until topsails
were flat as boards, and the schooner, hauled up,
had heeled to her scuppers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slap the stays&rsquo;l to her and up with the balloon.
Half the fleet&rsquo;s driving to the no&rsquo;the&rsquo;ard. Lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Johnnie liked that rarely. With the seventy-five
foot main-boom sheeted in to her rail, with
the thirty-seven-foot spike bowsprit poking a lane
in the sea when she dove and a path among the
clouds when she lifted, with her midship rail all but
flush with the sea and the night breeze to sing to
her&ndash;&ndash;of course she liked it, and she showed her
liking. She&rsquo;d tear herself apart now before she&rsquo;d
let anything in the fleet go by her. And red and
green lights were racing to both quarters of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the boat!&rdquo; It was the skipper&rsquo;s voice
again, and fifteen men leaped over the rail at the
word. Two dropped into the dory and thirteen
jumped from the vessel&rsquo;s rail onto thwarts or netting
or into the bottom of the seine-boat&ndash;&ndash;anywhere
at all so that they get in quickly. As extra
hand on deck I had to stand by and pay out the
painter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>In the middle of it came the skipper sliding
down from the mast-head. &ldquo;Drop astern, boat and
dory,&rdquo; he called out, and himself leaped over the
quarter and onto the pile of netting as into the
Johnnie&rsquo;s boiling wake they went. The thirty-eight-foot
seine-boat was checked up a dozen
fathoms astern, and the dory just astern of that.
The two men in the dory had to fend off desperately
as they slid by the seine-boat.</p>
<p>On the deck of the Johnnie were the cook, who
had the wheel, and myself, who had to stand by
the sheets. There would be stirring times soon,
for even from the deck occasional flashes of light,
marking small pods of mackerel, could be made
out on the surface of the sea. Clancy, now at the
mast-head alone, was noting these signs, we felt
sure, and with them a whole lot of other things.
To the mast-heads of other vessels out in the night
were other skippers, or seine-masters, and all with
skill and nerve and a great will to get fish.</p>
<p>The Johnnie was making perhaps ten knots good
now, and with every jerk the painter of the seine-boat
chafed and groaned in the taffrail chock.
The skipper from the boat called for more line.
&ldquo;Slack away a bit, slack away. We&rsquo;re not
porpoises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I jumped to attend to the painter just as Clancy&rsquo;s
voice broke in from above: &ldquo;Swing her off about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
two points, ease your main sheet and keep an eye
on that light to looard. Off, off&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s good&ndash;&ndash;hold
her&ndash;&ndash;and Joe, slack stays&rsquo;l and then foretops&rsquo;l
halyards. Be ready to let go balloon halyards and
stand by down-haul. Look alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paid out some sheet from the bitt by the wheel-box,
unbuttoned the after stays&rsquo;l tack, jumped forward
and loosed up halyards till her kites dropped
limp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with your balloon there&ndash;&ndash;and at the
wheel there, jibe her over. Watch out for that
fellow astern&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s pretty handy to our boat.
Watch out in boat and dory!&rdquo; The last warning
was a roar.</p>
<p>The big balloon gossamer came rattling down
the long stay and the jaws of the booms ratched,
fore and main, as they swung over. From astern
came the voices of the men in boat and dory, warning
each other to hang on when they felt her jibing.
Some of them must have come near to being
jerked overboard. &ldquo;Why in God&rsquo;s name don&rsquo;t you
slack that painter?&rdquo; came the voice of the skipper
from the boat.</p>
<p>I leaped to give them more painter, and &ldquo;Draw
away your jib&ndash;&ndash;draw away your jumbo,&rdquo; came
from aloft. Sheets were barely fast when it was:
&ldquo;Steady at the wheel, George&ndash;&ndash;steady her&ndash;&ndash;ste-a-dy&ndash;&ndash;Great
God! man, if you can&rsquo;t see can&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
you feel that fellow just ahead? And, skipper, tell
them to close their jaws astern there&ndash;&ndash;water won&rsquo;t
hurt &rsquo;em. Ready all now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; roared back the skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Down with your wheel a bit now,
George. Down&ndash;&ndash;more yet. Hold her there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vessels that we had dodged by this bit of
luffing were now dropping by us; one red light was
slowly sliding past our quarter to port, and one
green shooting by our bow to starboard. Evidently
Clancy had only been waiting to steer clear of
these two neighbors, for there was plenty of fish in
sight now. The sea was flashing with trails of
them. Clancy now began to bite out commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand ready everybody. In the boat and dory
there&ndash;&ndash;is everything ready, skipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready, boat and dory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out came Clancy&rsquo;s orders then&ndash;&ndash;rapid fire&ndash;&ndash;and
as he ripped them out, no whistling wind
could smother his voice, no swash of the sea could
drown it. In boat, dory and on deck, every brain
glowed to understand and every heart pumped to
obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with your wheel, George, and let her swing
by. Stea-dy. Ready in the boat. Steady your
wheel. Are you ready in the boat? Let her swing
off a little more, George. Steady&ndash;&ndash;hold her there.
Stand by in the boat. Now then&ndash;&ndash;now! Cast off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
your painter, cast off and pull to the west&rsquo;ard.
And drive her! Up with the wheel. More yet&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
good. Drive her, I say, skipper. Where&rsquo;s
that dory?&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t see the dory. The dory, the
dory&ndash;&ndash;where in hell&rsquo;s the dory?&ndash;&ndash;show that lantern
in the dory. All right, the dory. Hold her
up, George. Don&rsquo;t let her swing off another inch
now. Drive her, boys, drive her! Look out now!
Stand by the seine! Stand by&ndash;&ndash;the twine&ndash;&ndash;do you
hear, Steve! The twine! Drive her&ndash;&ndash;drive her&ndash;&ndash;blessed
Lord! drive her. That&rsquo;s the stuff, skipper,
drive her! Let her come up, George. Down
with your wheel&ndash;&ndash;down with you wheel&ndash;&ndash;ste-a-dy.
Drive her, skipper, drive her! Turn in now&ndash;&ndash;in&ndash;&ndash;shorter
yet. Drive her now&ndash;&ndash;where&rsquo;s that
dory!&ndash;&ndash;hold her up!&ndash;&ndash;not you, George! you&rsquo;re all
right&ndash;&ndash;ste-a-dy. Hold that dory up to the wind!&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
it, boys&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re all right&ndash;&ndash;straight ahead
now! That&rsquo;s the stuff. Turn her in now again,
skipper. In the dory there&ndash;&ndash;show your lantern in
the dory and be ready for the seine-boat. Good
enough. Now cover your lantern in the dory and
haul away when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To have experienced the strain and drive of that
rush, to have held an oar in the boat during that
and to have shared with the men in the confidence
they gathered&ndash;&ndash;ours was a skipper to steer a boat
around a school&ndash;&ndash;and the soul that rang in Clancy&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
voice!&ndash;&ndash;why, just to stand on deck, as I did,
and listen to it&ndash;&ndash;it was like living.</p>
<p>During this dash we could make out neither boat
nor dory from deck, but the flashes of light raised
by the oars at every stroke were plainly to be seen
in that phosphorescent sea. Certainly they were
making that boat hop along! Ten good men,
with every man a long, broad blade, and double
banked, so that every man might encourage his
mate and be himself spurred on by desperate effort.
Legs, arms, shoulders, back, all went into it and
their wake alive with smoke and fire to tell them
they were moving! To be in that?&ndash;&ndash;The middle
of a black night on the Atlantic was this, and the
big seine-heaver was throwing the seine in great
armfuls. And Hurd and Parsons in the little dory
tossing behind and gamely trying to keep up!
They were glad enough to be in the dory, I know,
to get hold of the buoy, and you can be sure there
was some lively action aboard of her when Clancy
called so fiercely to them to hold the buoy up to
the wind, so that the efforts of the crew of the
seine-boat, racing to get their two hundred odd
fathoms of twine fence around the flying school,
might not go for naught.</p>

<a name='XVI_WE_GET_A_FINE_SCHOOL' id='XVI_WE_GET_A_FINE_SCHOOL'></a>
<h2>XVI</h2>
<h3>WE GET A FINE SCHOOL</h3>
</div>
<p>With his &ldquo;Haul away now when you&rsquo;re
ready,&rdquo; Clancy came down from aloft.
He was sliding down evidently by way of the jib
halyards, for there was the sound of a chafing
whiz that could be nothing else than the friction
of oilskins against taut manila rope, a sudden
check, as of a block met on the way, an impatient,
soft, little forgivable oath, and then a plump!
that meant that he must have dropped the last
twelve or fifteen feet to the deck. Immediately
came the scurry of his boot-heels as he hurried aft.
In another moment he stood in the glow of the
binnacle light, and reaching back toward the
shadow of the cook, but never turning his head
from that spot out in the dark where he had last
seen the boat, he took the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, George, I&rsquo;ve got you. A good-sized
school, by the looks, if they got them, and I think
they have. Did you see that boat ahead we near
ran into?&ndash;&ndash;the last time we put the wheel down?
Man, but for a second I thought they were gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
I hope no blessed vessel comes as near to our fellows.
And they were so busy rowing and heaving
twine they never saw us, and myself nearly
cross-eyed trying to watch them and our own boat
and the fish all the time. Go below, George, she&rsquo;s
all right now, and tell Joe&ndash;&ndash;where is he?&ndash;&ndash;to go
below, too, and have a mug-up for himself. He
must be soaked through taking the swash that
must&rsquo;ve come over her bow for the last hour. But
tell him to come right up so&rsquo;s to keep watch out
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go below, however, but standing by the
fore-rigging kept an eye out ahead. Clancy himself
stood to the wheel with his head ever turned
over one shoulder, until he saw the flare of a torch
from the seine-boat. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;What there is is safe now, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that his work was easy. He had only to
dodge the lights of other vessels now, the old red
and green lights that had been our neighbors all
that evening, and a few new yellow flares that came
from other seine-boats. So his eyes ranged the
blackness and in rings about his own seine-boat he
sailed the Johnnie Duncan. That the crew were
quite a little while pursing up only gave him satisfaction.
&ldquo;A nice school, Joe, if they got it all,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;a nice school of &rsquo;em.&rdquo; And after a pause,
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll stand down and have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>He ran down, luffed, and hailed, &ldquo;Hi&ndash;&ndash;skipper,
what&rsquo;s it like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the row of figures that were seen to be
crowding gunnel and thwarts and hauling on the
seine, one shadow straightened up beside the smoky
torch and spoke. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be sure yet, Tommie, but
things look all right so far. A fair-sized school if
we don&rsquo;t lose &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, don&rsquo;t lose &rsquo;em, skipper, though I think
you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em fast enough now. Sounds natural
to hear &rsquo;em flipping inside the corks, don&rsquo;t it?
Ought to be hurrying &rsquo;em up, skipper&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s getting
along in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy, very well satisfied, stood away again and
continued to sail triangles around boat and dory.
Being now clear of the greater part of the mental
strain his spirits began to lighten. Merely by way
of being sociable with himself he hummed some
old ditties. There was that about the old coaster,
the Eliza Jane. I liked to hear him sing that, as,
dancing a one-footed jig-step by the wheel-box, he
bumped it out:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the &rsquo;Liza Jane with a blue foremast</p>
<p>And a load of hay came drifting past.</p>
<p>Her skipper stood aft and he said, &lsquo;How do?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the &rsquo;Liza Jane and who be you?&rsquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>He stood by the wheel and he says, &lsquo;How do?</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>We&rsquo;re from Bangor, Maine&ndash;&ndash;from where be you?&rsquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The &rsquo;Liza Jane got a new main truck&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>A darn fine thing but wouldn&rsquo;t stay stuck.</p>
<p>Came a breeze one day from the no&rsquo;-no&rsquo;-west</p>
<p>And the gosh-darned thing came down with the rest.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Oh, hi-diddle-di&ndash;&ndash;a breeze from the west&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Who&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; thunk the truck wouldn&rsquo;t stuck with the rest?</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the &rsquo;Liza Jane left the wharf one day,</p>
<p>A fine flood tide and the day Friday,</p>
<p>But the darned old tide sent her bow askew</p>
<p>And the &rsquo;Liza Jane began for to slew.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Oh, hi-diddle-di&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; fairly flew,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>If she only could sail the other end to.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the &rsquo;Liza Jane left port one day,</p>
<p>With her hold full of squash and her deck all hay.</p>
<p>Two years back with her sails all set</p>
<p>She put from Bath&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s sailing yet.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Oh, hi-diddle-di for a good old craft</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>She&rsquo;d &rsquo;ve sailed very well with her bow on aft.&ldquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>There was a long story to the Eliza Jane, but
Clancy did not finish it. Maybe he felt that it was
not in harmony with that lowering sky or that
flashing sea. Maybe, too, in the waters that rolled
and the wake that smoked was the inspiration for
something more stirring. At any rate he began, in
a voice that carried far, an old ballad of the war
of 1812.</p>
<p>Two or three more stanzas to warm up, and
the fight was on. And you would think Clancy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
was in it. He laid every mast and yard of the
enemy over the side of her, he made her decks run
with blood, and at the last, in a noble effort, he
caused her to strike her flag.</p>
<p>By the time he had finished that, it happened
that we were running before the wind, and, going
so, it was very quiet aboard the vessel. There was
none of the close-hauled wash through her scuppers,
nor was there much play of wind through
stays and halyards. It was in fact unusually quiet,
and it needed only that to set Clancy off on a more
melancholy tack. So in a subdued voice he began
the recitation of one of the incidents that have
helped to make orphans of Gloucester children:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve good vessels fighting through the night</p>
<p>Fighting, fighting, that no&rsquo;the-east gale;</p>
<p>Every man, be sure, did his might,</p>
<p>But never a sign of a single sail</p>
<p>Was there in the morning when the sun shone red,</p>
<p>But a hundred and seventy fine men&ndash;&ndash;dead&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Were settling somewhere into the sand</p>
<p>On Georges shoals, which is Drowned Men&rsquo;s Land.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy widows kneeling&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>A long hail came over the water and a torch was
raised and lowered. &ldquo;Hi-i&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; hallooed the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi-i-i&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; hallooed back Clancy as he pulled
down his wheel. You might have thought he intended
to run over them. But no, for at the very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
last second he threw her up cleverly and let her
settle beside the boat, from which most of the men
came tumbling immediately over the side of the
vessel. Of those who stayed, one shackled the
boat&rsquo;s bow onto the iron that hung from the boom
at the fore-rigging, and having done that, braced
an oar between himself and the vessel&rsquo;s run to hold
the boat away and steady while another in the
stern of the boat did the same thing with his oar.
In the boat&rsquo;s waist two men hung onto the seine.</p>
<p>A section of the cork edge of the seine was then
gathered inboard and clamped down over the vessel&rsquo;s
rail, with the mackerel crowded into the
middle part, and the bunt of the seine thus held
safely between boat and vessel. Into this space
the sea swashed and slapped after a manner that
kept all in the boat completely drenched and made
it pretty hard for the men in bow and stern to fend
off and retain their balance at the same time.</p>
<p>And then began the bailing in. Guided by the
skipper, who stood on the break, our big dip-net,
which could hold a barrel easily, was dropped over
the rail and in among the kicking fish. A twist
and a turn and &ldquo;He-yew!&rdquo; the skipper yelled.
&ldquo;Oy-hoo!&rdquo; grunted the two gangs of us at the halyards,
and into the air and over the rail swung the
dip-net, swimming full. &ldquo;Down!&rdquo; We let it sag
quickly to Clancy and Parsons, who were at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
rail. &ldquo;Hi-o!&rdquo; they called cheerfully, and turned
the dip-net inside out. Out and down it went
again, &ldquo;He-yew!&rdquo; and up and in it came again.
&ldquo;Oy-hoo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hi-o!&rdquo; and flop! it was turned upside
down and another barrel of fat, lusty fish
flipped their length against the hard deck. Head
and tail they flipped, each head and tail ten
times a second seemingly, until it sounded&ndash;&ndash;they
beat the deck so frantically&ndash;&ndash;as if a regiment of
gentle little drummer boys were tapping a low but
wonderfully quick-sounding roll. Scales flew. We
found some next morning glued to the mast-head.
I never can get some people to believe that it is so&ndash;&ndash;mackerel
scales to the mast-head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He-yew!&rdquo; called the skipper, &ldquo;Oy-hoo!&rdquo; hollered
the halyards gang, &ldquo;Hi-o!&rdquo; sung out Clancy
and Parsons cheerily at the rail. &ldquo;Fine fat fish,&rdquo;
commented the men in the seine-boat, the only men
who had time to draw an extra breath.</p>
<p>Blazing torches were all around us. Arms
worked up and down, big boots stamped, while inboard
and out swung the dip-net, and onto the deck
flopped the mackerel. &ldquo;Drive her!&rdquo; called the
skipper, and &ldquo;He-yew!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oy-hoo!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hi-o!&rdquo;
it went. Drenched oilskins steamed, wet faces
glowed, glad eyes shone through the smoke flare,
and the pitching vessel, left to herself, plunged up
and down to the lift and fall of every sea.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>A DRIVE FOR MARKET</h3>
</div>
<p>Her deck was pretty well filled with mackerel
when &ldquo;All dry,&rdquo; said Long Steve, and drew
the last of the seine into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then hurry aboard and drop that seine-boat
astern. And&ndash;&ndash;whose watch? Take the wheel&ndash;&ndash;wait
till I give you the course&ndash;&ndash;there. But don&rsquo;t
drive her awhile yet. Some of those fish might be
washed over. But it won&rsquo;t be for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready with the ice?&rdquo; he asked next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; and the men who had been chopping
ice and making ready the pens in the hold
stood by to take the mackerel as we passed them
down.</p>
<p>As soon as we had enough of them off the
vessel&rsquo;s deck to make it safe to drive her, the skipper
gave her a little more sheet and let her go for
New York. We hustled the seine-boat aboard too.
Some other vessels must have got fish, too, and
there was no time to waste.</p>
<p>It was a good-sized school and when we had
them all iced and below&ndash;&ndash;more than thirty thousand
count&ndash;&ndash;it was time for all hands to turn in&ndash;&ndash;all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
but the two men on watch of course. I didn&rsquo;t
turn in myself, but after a mug-up and pipeful below
came on deck again. It was a pretty good sort
of a night for a dark night, with a moderate breeze
that sang in your ears when you leaned against the
halyards and a sea that lapped bucketfuls of spray
over her rail forward and that tumbled away in a
wide flat hump as our quarter slipped on and left
it behind.</p>
<p>I found the skipper leaning against the weather
rigging and watching a red light coming up on us.
Noticing me he said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that porgy steamer
that we beat out for that school the other day
overhauling us now. There&rsquo;s the beauty of steam.
The crew of this one knows more in a minute than
they know in a week about fishing in that steamer,
and we&rsquo;d be carrying our summer kites when that
gang, if they were in a sailing vessel, would be
laying to an anchor; and with our boat out and
their boat out and a school in sight they&rsquo;d have
to take our leavings. But here&rsquo;s one of the times
when they have the best of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much wind stirring then, but it
promised to breeze up, or so the skipper thought,
and I&rsquo;m sure I was glad to hear him say it, for
the harder it blew the sooner we would get to New
York and the better our chance to beat the porgyman.
First in to market got the cream.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>It was pretty well on to daybreak when the
porgy steamer got up abreast of us and after
a while worked by. One of them took the trouble
to sing out to us when they went by, &ldquo;Well, you got
a school before us, but we&rsquo;ll be tied up and into
the dock and spending our money ashore whilst
you&rsquo;re still along the Jersey coast somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we supposed they would, but Hurd, who
was then to our wheel, had to call back to them,
&ldquo;Oh, I dunno. I dunno about that&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a good
run to Fulton Market dock yet.&rdquo; And, turning to
us, &ldquo;I hope the bloody old boiler explodes so nobody&rsquo;ll
be able to find a mackerel of &rsquo;em this side
the Bay of Fundy. Of course I wouldn&rsquo;t want to
see the men come to any harm, but wouldn&rsquo;t it jar
you&ndash;&ndash;them scrubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper wasn&rsquo;t saying anything. And it
meant a lot to him, too. He was looking after the
steamer and, I know, praying for wind. We could
see it in his eyes.</p>
<p>And sometimes things come as we like to have
them. At full dawn it was a nice breeze with the
Johnnie Duncan washing her face in plenty of good
spray and the fine sun shining warm on a fresh
sea-way. Another hour, the wind hauling and still
making, the Johnnie was down to her rail, and
awhile after that she was getting all the wind she
needed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We may have a chance to try her out on this
run, who knows?&rdquo; said the skipper. We were
coming up on the porgy steamer then and you
should have seen his eyes when they looked from
the rail to the deck of his vessel and from the
deck again to aloft. On the steamer the gang were
in the waist watching us coming and they must
have been piling the coal into her below and giving
her the jet steadily, for out of her funnel was
coming the smoke in clouds mixed with steam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But their firemen can stoke till they&rsquo;re black in
the face and they won&rsquo;t get more than eleven or
eleven and a half knots out of her,&rdquo; said Clancy.
&ldquo;I know her&ndash;&ndash;the Nautilus&ndash;&ndash;and if this one under
us ain&rsquo;t logging her fourteen good then I don&rsquo;t
know. And she&rsquo;ll be doing better yet before we
see New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were driving the porgyman then, but she
was fated. Once we began to get her she came
back to us fast enough, and once she was astern
she troubled us no more. After the porgyman we
passed a big white yacht, evidently just up from
the West Indies after a winter&rsquo;s cruise. She looked
a model for a good sailer, but there was no chance
to try her out, for they had her under shortened
sail when we went by.</p>
<p>There was a New York blue-fisherman on our
weather bow bound for New York, too, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
way we went by her was a scandal. And farther
on we drove by a big bark&ndash;&ndash;big enough, almost,
to take us aboard. They were plainly trying to
make a passage on her, but we left her too. Then
we passed another yacht, but she wasn&rsquo;t carrying
half our sail. Her hull was as long as ours, but
she didn&rsquo;t begin to be sparred as we were. We
must have had ten feet on her main-boom and ten
feet more bowsprit outboard, and yet under her
four lower sails she seemed to be making heavy
going of it. It&rsquo;s a good yacht that can hold a fisherman
in a breeze and a sea-way. We beat this
one about as bad as we beat the blue-fisherman.
As we went by we tried to look as though we had
beaten so many vessels that we&rsquo;d lost all interest in
racing, and at the same time we were all dancing
on our toes to think what a vessel we had under
us. It was that passage we held the north-bound
Savannah steamer for seven hours. Her passengers
stood by the rail and watched us, and when
at last we crowded our bowsprit past her nose, they
waved their handkerchiefs and cheered us like
mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we get this one loosened up a bit and
down to her trim, she&rsquo;ll sail some or I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
said our skipper. He stood in the cabin gangway
then and filled his boots with water, but he wouldn&rsquo;t
take in sail. Back behind us was another seiner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
We could just make out that they were soaking it
to her too. The skipper nodded his head back
at her. Then, with one hand on the house and the
other on the rail, he looked out from under our
main-boom and across at the steamer. &ldquo;Not a rag&ndash;&ndash;let
the spars come out of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing was sure&ndash;&ndash;the Johnnie was a vessel
that could stand driving. She didn&rsquo;t crowd herself
as she got going. No, sir! The harder we
drove her the faster she went. Laying down on
her side made no difference to her. In fact we were
not sure that she wouldn&rsquo;t do her best sailing on
her side. But it hadn&rsquo;t come to that yet. She was
standing up under sail fine. Most of them, we
knew, would have washed everything off their deck
before that. And certainly there would have been
no standing down by the lee rail on too many of
them with that breeze abeam.</p>
<p>Going up New York harbor, where we had to
tack, the Savannah steamer could have gone by if
she had to, but big steamers slow down some going
into a harbor, and we holding on to everything
made up for the extra distance sailed. The wind,
of course, was nothing to what it was outside, and
that made some difference. Anyway, we kept the
Johnnie going and held the steamer up to the Battery,
where, as she had to go up North River, she
gave us three toots. The people on the Battery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
must have had a good look at us. I guess it was
not every day they saw a schooner of the Johnnie&rsquo;s
size carrying on like that. Billie Hurd had to pay
his respects to them. &ldquo;Look, you loafers, look,
and see a real vessel sailing in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sassy little East River towboat that
wanted to give us a tow, but our skipper said it
would be losing time to take sail off and wait for a
line then. The tug captain said, &ldquo;Oh, no; and
you can&rsquo;t dock her anyway in this harbor without
a tug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can dock her all right, I guess,&rdquo; said our
skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you think you can, but wait till you try
it, and have a nice little bill for damages besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the vessel&rsquo;s good for the damages, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That towboat tailed us just the same, but we
had the satisfaction of fooling him. The skipper
kept the Johnnie going till the right time and then,
when the tugboat people thought it was too late,
he shot her about on her heel and into the dock
with her mainsail coming down on the run and
jibs dead.</p>
<p>A couple of East Side loafers standing on the
wharf cap-log were nearly swept away by the end
of our bowsprit, we came on so fast. Four or five
of us leaped ashore, and with lines out and made
fast in no time, we had her docked without so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
as cracking a single shingle of the house across the
head of the dock.</p>
<p>We sold our mackerel for nineteen cents apiece.
Fifty-seven hundred and odd dollars was our stock,
and about a hundred and forty dollars each man&rsquo;s
share. We felt a little bit chesty after that. We
were not the first to market that year, but we were
the first since the early flurry, and the biggest stock
so far that spring was to our credit.</p>
<p>We stood on the deck and watched the porgy
steamer come in and tie up, too late for that day&rsquo;s
market. Some of our fellows had to ask them
where they got their fish&ndash;&ndash;to the s&rsquo;uth&rsquo;ard or
where?&ndash;&ndash;and two or three fights came out of it,
but no harm done. Then nearly everybody drew
some money off the skipper, and we smoked fifteen-cent
cigars and threw our chests out. We all went
uptown, too, and took in the theatres that night,
and afterwards treated each other and pretty
nearly everybody else that we met along the East
Side on the way back, until the policemen began to
notice us and ask if we didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d better
be getting back to our ships. One or two of the
crew had to get into fights with the toughs along
the water front, but we were all safely aboard by
three o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>All but Clancy. Some of us were trying to get
some sleep along towards morning when Clancy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
came aboard with a fine shore list. The cook, who
was up and stirring about for breakfast, noticed
him first. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine list you&rsquo;ve got, Tommie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&ndash;&ndash;and a fine beam wind coming
down the street. I&rsquo;m like a lot of other deep-draught
craft of good model, George&ndash;&ndash;I sail best
with the wind abeam. A bit of a list gets you
down to your lines.&rdquo; And until we turned out for
breakfast, after which it was time to be off and
away to the fleet again, he kept us all in a roar with
the story of his adventures.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>
<h3>A BRUSH WITH THE YACHTING FLEET</h3>
</div>
<p>Through all of that month and through
most of the month of May we chased the
mackerel up the coast. By the middle of May
we were well up front with the killers, and our
skipper&rsquo;s reputation was gaining. The vessel, too,
was getting quite a name as a sailer. Along the
Maryland, Delaware, and Jersey coasts we chased
them&ndash;&ndash;on up to off Sandy Hook and then along
the Long Island shore, running them fresh into
New York. There were nights and days that
spring when we saw some driving on the Johnnie
Duncan.</p>
<p>Toward the end of May, with the fish schooling
easterly to off No Man&rsquo;s Land and reported as
being seen on Georges and in the Bay of Fundy&ndash;&ndash;working
to the eastward all the time&ndash;&ndash;we thought
the skipper would put for home, take in salt, fill
the hold with barrels and refit for a Cape Shore
trip&ndash;&ndash;that is, head the fish off along the Nova
Scotia shore, from Cape Sable and on to anywhere
around the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and stay there
until we had filled her up with salt mackerel. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
thought so, because most of the fleet had decided
on that plan and because we had been away from
home since the first of April. But no&ndash;&ndash;he stayed
cruising off Block Island and running them fresh
into Newport with the last half-dozen of the fleet.</p>
<p>Our idea of it was that the skipper wanted to go
home badly enough, but he was set on getting a
big stock and didn&rsquo;t care what it cost himself or us
to get it. Some of us would have given a lot to
be home.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fine blue sky and a fine blue sea</p>
<p>And a blue-eyed girl awaiting me,&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>was how Clancy put it as he came down from aloft
one afternoon and took the wheel from me. &ldquo;By
the wind is it, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the wind,&rdquo; I said&ndash;&ndash;the usual word when
seiners are cruising for mackerel, and I went aloft
to take his place at the mast-head. It was a lazy
watch, as the mackerel generally were not showing
at this time in the middle of the day. They seemed
to prefer the early morning or the late afternoon,
or above all a dark night.</p>
<p>Long Steve, who came up this day to pass the
time with me aloft, had been telling me about his
old home, when we both noticed the topsails of
what we knew must be the first of a fleet of big
schooner yachts racing to Newport&ndash;&ndash;from New
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
York, no doubt, on one of their ocean races. Steve,
of course, had to try to name the leader, while
she was yet miles away&ndash;&ndash;seiners have wonderful
eyes for vessels&ndash;&ndash;and was still at it, naming the
others behind, when the next on watch relieved
me and I went below.</p>
<p>The first of the yachts was almost on us when
I came down, and Clancy was watching her like
a hawk when he turned the wheel over to the next
man. She was as about as big as we were. We
knew her well. She had been a cup defender and
afterwards changed to a schooner rig. Our skipper
was taking a nap below at this time, or we supposed
he was. He had been up nearly a week,
with no more than a two-hours&rsquo; sleep each day, and
so was pretty well tired. That was what made
Clancy stand by the wheel and ask if the skipper
was still asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the skipper himself. He had just
turned out, and in his stocking feet he came to the
companionway and looked up. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s this big yacht crawling by on our quarter&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;ll
be by us soon. I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right up. Tell the gang to sway up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew on his slip-shods and came on deck.
He took a look over at the yacht while we were
swaying up. When we had everything good and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
flat and trimmed sheets a bit, the skipper called
out to take in the fore-topsail. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t got hers
set,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Now, a fore-topsail does not help much&ndash;&ndash;hauled
up, as were the Johnnie Duncan and the yacht, it
would be a hindrance to most vessels, and, perhaps,
because it did not help her was why the yacht had
not hers set. But it showed the skipper&rsquo;s fairness.
Ours had been left set, because we might need it
in a hurry, and also because with the skipper below
nobody could order it down. Now we clewed
it up.</p>
<p>Clancy, standing aft, threw a look at our seine-boat,
which of course we had in tow. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite
a drag,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;for a vessel that&rsquo;s racing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the skipper, &ldquo;but wait a while. We
won&rsquo;t cast it off unless we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did not have to. We soon had her in trim.
For weeks the skipper and Clancy had been marking
the Johnnie&rsquo;s sheets so that in an emergency
they could whip her into her best sailing in no time.
With that, and with the shifting of some barrels
of salt that we had on deck, we soon had her going.
It is surprising what a lot of difference the shifting
of a few barrels of salt will make in the trim of a
vessel. We had not had a try with anything for
two weeks or so and had become careless. The
last thing we did was to take some barrels of fresh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
water that happened to be standing forward of the
windlass and shift them aft, and then the Johnnie
began to go along for fair.</p>
<p>Coming up to Block Island Light things were
pretty even. Then it came a question of who was
to go to windward. The yacht hauled her mainsheet
in to two blocks. So did we, and, further, ran
a line from the cringle in her foresail to the
weather rigging. She could not make it&ndash;&ndash;we had
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind the time,&rdquo; said the skipper, when at
last we had her under our quarter&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;mind the
time, Tommie, when we used to do so much racing
down on the Cape shore? There&rsquo;s where we had
plenty of time for racing and all sorts of foolishness.
I was pretty young then, but I mind it well.
A string of men on the rigging from the shear
poles clear up to the mast-head&ndash;&ndash;yes, and a man
astraddle the main gaff once or twice, passing
buckets of water to wet down the mains&rsquo;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and barrels of water out toward the
end of the main-boom keep the sail stretched.
Man, but those were the days we paid attention
to racing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were the days,&rdquo; asserted the skipper.
&ldquo;But we can do a little of it now, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By that you will understand we were walking
away from our yacht. We were to anchor in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
harbor while she was still coming, and we had
towed our seine-boat all the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Clancy, as we were tying up our
foresail, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to see this one in an ocean
race with plenty of wind stirring&ndash;&ndash;not a flat
breeze and a short drag like we had to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>
<h3>MINNIE ARKELL AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Coming on to dark that night a gig put off
from the schooner-yacht and rowed over
to us. On the way she was hailed and passed a
few words with a steam-yacht anchored in between.
The man in the stern of the gig was not satisfied
until he had been rowed three times around the
Johnnie. When he had looked his fill he came
alongside.</p>
<p>He mistook Clancy for the skipper. I suppose
he couldn&rsquo;t imagine a man of Clancy&rsquo;s figure and
bearing to be an ordinary hand on a fisherman. So
to Clancy he said, &ldquo;Captain, you&rsquo;ve got a wonderful
vessel here. Put a single stick in her and she&rsquo;ll
beat the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clancy, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;d be a hell of a
fine fisherman then, wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of us had to roar at that. We at once
pictured the Johnnie rigged up as a sloop out on
the Grand Banks, trawling or hand-lining, with
the crew trying to handle her in some of the winter
gales that struck in there. And a great chance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
she would have rigged as a sloop and her one
big sail, making a winter passage home eight or
nine or ten hundred miles, when as it was, with
the sail split up to schooner rig, men found it bad
enough.</p>
<p>The master of the yacht had a message for our
captain, he said, and Clancy told him the skipper
was below. There they talked for a while and
after the yachtsman had gone Maurice, inviting
four or five of us along, dressed up, called for the
seine-boat, got in and was rowed over to a steam-yacht
that we now remembered had hailed the
schooner-yacht&rsquo;s gig. All brass and varnish and
white paint and gold she would be in the daytime,
but now she was all lit up with electric lights below
and Japanese lanterns on deck.</p>
<p>When we came alongside, who should come to
the gangway of the yacht and welcome Maurice
but Minnie Arkell&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Miner. She greeted all
of us for that matter&ndash;&ndash;she never pretended not to
see people&ndash;&ndash;and invited us all below for refreshments.
There was a good lay-out there and we
pitched into it. Seiners are great people at table
or in a bunk. They can turn to and eat, or turn
in and sleep any minute, day or night. So now we
turned to. Clancy did great things to the wine.
Generally he took whiskey, but he did not object
to good wine now and then. He and one fellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
in a blue coat, white duck trousers, and a blue cap
that never left his head, had a great chat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I callate that if he didn&rsquo;t have that cap with
the button on front nobody&rsquo;d know he was a real
yachtsman, would they?&rdquo; Eddie Parsons whispered
in my ear.</p>
<p>The owner of the steam-yacht was trying to convince
Tommie that yachting would be more in his
line than fishing, but Tommie couldn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not?&rdquo; he asked at last. &ldquo;Why not,
Mr. Clancy? Is it a matter of money? If it is,
I&rsquo;ll make that right. I pay ordinary hands twenty-five
and thirty dollars a month and found, but I&rsquo;ll
pay you fifty&ndash;&ndash;sixty&ndash;&ndash;seventy dollars a month to
go with me. I&rsquo;m going to race this steamer this
summer and I want a quartermaster&ndash;&ndash;a man like
you that can steer to a hair-line. Seventy dollars
a month now&ndash;&ndash;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, my good man, what do you say?&rdquo;
Clancy got that off without so much as a smile.
&ldquo;But you couldn&rsquo;t make it seventy-five now, could
you? No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that quite, though I&rsquo;ve
been out the dock in Gloucester of a Saturday noon
and back again to the dock of a Tuesday noon&ndash;&ndash;three
days&ndash;&ndash;and shared two hundred dollars&ndash;&ndash;not
as skipper, mind you, but just as hand. There
now, I hope you&rsquo;re not going to get angry. Hadn&rsquo;t
we better have another little touch? But I can see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
myself in a suit of white duck, touching my cap,
and saying, &lsquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rsquo; to some slob&ndash;&ndash;no reference
to you, mind you&ndash;&ndash;but some slob in a uniform
that&rsquo;s got a yacht, not because he loves the sea,
but because he wants to butt in somewhere&ndash;&ndash;who
lives aboard his yacht just the same as he does in
his house ashore&ndash;&ndash;electric bells, baths, servants,
barber and all&ndash;&ndash;and hugs the shore so close that he
gets the morning paper as regularly as when he&rsquo;s
at home. When that kind go yachting all they
miss are the tables on the lawn and the automobiles
going by the door. They even have canary-birds&ndash;&ndash;some
of them&ndash;&ndash;in cages. Yes, and wouldn&rsquo;t
be caught twenty miles off shore&ndash;&ndash;no, not even in
a summer&rsquo;s breeze for&ndash;&ndash;And where would he be
in a winter&rsquo;s gale? I can see myself rowing a gig
with somebody like that in the stern giving orders
and fooling&ndash;&ndash;well, some simple-minded women
folks, maybe, who know as much of the sea as
they do of the next world&ndash;&ndash;most of them&ndash;&ndash;fooling
them into believing that he&rsquo;s a devil&ndash;&ndash;yes, a clean
devil on the water. Seventy a month for that?&ndash;&ndash;couldn&rsquo;t
you make it seventy-five?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clancy, &ldquo;I do. I&rsquo;d rather stick to
fishing than&ndash;&ndash;but here&rsquo;s a shoot and let&rsquo;s call the
quartermaster&rsquo;s job off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minnie Arkell chimed in here. &ldquo;A real fisherman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
you must remember, Mr. Keith, doesn&rsquo;t care
much for yachting because&ndash;&ndash;leaving out the question
of wages, for he does make more at fishing&ndash;&ndash;he
can remain a fisherman and yet be independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean they don&rsquo;t have to take orders as
if they were on a yacht, Mrs. Miner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t make any mistake there. The
discipline of a yacht, so far as I know it, is baby
play to what they have on a good fisherman. The
discipline aboard a warship is nothing to that
aboard a fisherman, like Captain Blake&rsquo;s vessel
say, when there is anything to be done. Fishermen,
it&rsquo;s true, don&rsquo;t have to touch their caps and
say, &lsquo;Very good, sir,&rsquo; to a man who may be no more
of a real man than themselves. On your yacht I
suppose you&rsquo;d discharge a man who didn&rsquo;t do what
he was told, and on a warship he would be sent
to the brig, I suppose. On a fisherman he&rsquo;d be put
ashore. On a fisherman they not only obey orders,
but they carry them out on the jump. And why?
Because they&rsquo;ve always done it. Why, deep-sea
fishermen are always getting into places where only
the best of seamanship can save them, and they
very early get in the way of doing things up quick
and right. When a Gloucester skipper orders in
the sail, say in a gale of wind, and more than apt
to be in the middle of the night&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
men trying to see how long it will take them to
get into oilskins&ndash;&ndash;or filling another pipe before
they climb on deck. No, sir&ndash;&ndash;the first man out on
the bowsprit, if it&rsquo;s the jib to come in&ndash;&ndash;or out on
the foot-ropes, if it&rsquo;s the mainsail to be tied up&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
the man that will have a right to hold his head
high next day aboard that vessel. And so the
crew of a fisherman jump to their work&ndash;&ndash;if they
didn&rsquo;t there&rsquo;d be a lot more of them lost than
there are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Mr. Keith, &ldquo;that never occurred
to me before. But how is it, Mrs. Miner,
that you have it down so fine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was a Gloucester skipper, and since
I was that high&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she put her hand on a level
with her knee&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been listening to fishermen.
And yachting life does tend to spoil a fisherman,&rdquo;
she went on to explain. &ldquo;After a summer of yachting
a fisherman will begin to think that a winter
of fishing is going to be a serious thing.&rdquo; She was
warmed up then and went on talking at a great
rate. And listening to her I could understand better
why men took to her. She had warm blood in
her. If it were not for her weakness to be admired
by men, she would have been a great woman.
&ldquo;And they get so, that what seems extraordinary
work to you is only an every-day matter to them.
Do you remember that last schooner-yacht race
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
across the Atlantic?&ndash;&ndash;when two or three reporters
went along, and after they got back wrote all kinds
of stories of what a desperate trip it was&ndash;&ndash;how
rough it was and dangerous! Well, that time there
were three or four Gloucestermen making the run
to Iceland. Now, they were not as big as the
racing yachts and they were loaded down with all
the stores for a long salt trip&ndash;&ndash;their holds full of
salt, for one thing&ndash;&ndash;and yet they made about as
good time to Iceland as that yachtsman made to
Queenstown. And they weren&rsquo;t driving their vessels
either&ndash;&ndash;they don&rsquo;t drive on the way out. It&rsquo;s
only coming home that they try to make passages.
Now, they must have got the same weather and
yet nobody ever heard them in their letters home
report a word of bad weather, or ever afterward,
either. And yet&ndash;&ndash;but were you to Iceland that
time, Maurice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the skipper, &ldquo;but you were,
Tommie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Clancy, &ldquo;in the Lucy Foster.
We made Rik-ie-vik inside of fourteen days, carrying
both tops&rsquo;ls all the way. Wesley&ndash;&ndash;Wesley
Marrs&ndash;&ndash;wasn&rsquo;t hurrying her, of course. As Mrs.
Miner says, the vessels going to the east&rsquo;ard don&rsquo;t
hurry, except now and then when two of them
with records get together. And the Lucy was logy,
of course, with the three hundred and odd hogsheads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
of salt and other stuff in her. If we&rsquo;d been
driving her going to Iceland that time we&rsquo;d have
had the stays&rsquo;l and balloon to her&ndash;&ndash;and she&rsquo;d have
gone right along with them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Miner looked around at her yachting
friends to see if they were getting all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one day that passage it blew a
bit,&rdquo; exclaimed Clancy. &ldquo;And that was the day we
thought we saw a fellow to the east&rsquo;ard. We had
men by the halyards all that day with splitting
knives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Keith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to cut before she could capsize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Keith and said it with a little
click.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;ve seen the gang with
Tom O&rsquo;Donnell standing watch by the halyards
for days with axes when he was making a passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minnie Arkell filled another glass of champagne
for Clancy, and Clancy didn&rsquo;t give the fizz too
much time to melt away either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men are the real things,&rdquo; she said, but
Clancy, for fear we were getting too much credit,
broke in, &ldquo;Not us seiners. It&rsquo;s the winter fishermen&ndash;&ndash;trawlers
and hand-liners&ndash;&ndash;that are the real
things. Of course, we lose men now and then
seining, but it&rsquo;s in winter up on the shoal water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
on the Banks that&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s where you have some
seas to buck against,&rdquo; and he went on to tell of a
battle with a gale on a winter&rsquo;s night on the Grand
Banks. Clancy could tell a story as well as anybody
I ever met. He could make the blood jump
to your heart, or the tears to your eyes&ndash;&ndash;or he could
chill you till the blood froze. When he got
through you could hear them all breathing&ndash;&ndash;men
and women both, like people who had just run a
race. &ldquo;Two hundred and odd men sailing out of
Gloucester,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;went down that night.
There weren&rsquo;t too many came safe out of that
blow. The father of this boy here was lost&ndash;&ndash;the
Mary Buckley warn&rsquo;t it, Joe?&ndash;&ndash;named for your
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my father, too, was lost soon after,&rdquo; said
Minnie Arkell, and the glance she gave me melted
a lot of prejudice I had felt for her. That was the
good human side to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No better man ever sailed out of Gloucester,
Mrs. Miner,&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>She flushed up. &ldquo;Thank you, Tommie, for that,
though I know he was a reckless man.&rdquo; And, she
might have added, he left some of his recklessness
in the blood of the Arkells.</p>
<p>The skipper told them a lot about sea life that
night. Some of the stories he told, though long
known in Gloucester, they took to be yarns at first.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
They could not believe that men went through such
things and lived. And then the skipper had such
an easy way of telling them. After a man has
been through a lot of unusual things&ndash;&ndash;had them
years behind him and almost forgotten them&ndash;&ndash;I
suppose they don&rsquo;t surprise him any more.</p>
<p>The skipper looked well that night. When he
warmed up and his eyes took on a fresh shine and
his mouth softened like a woman&rsquo;s, I tell you he
was a winner. I could not help comparing him
with the steam-yacht owner, who was a good-looking
man, too, but in a different way. Both of them,
to look at, were of the same size. Both had their
clothes made by tailors who knew their business
and took pains with the fitting, though it was
easy to fit men like Clancy and the skipper, such
fine level shoulders and flat broad backs they had.
Now the skipper, as I say, when he warmed up
began to look something like what he ought&ndash;&ndash;like
he did when walking the quarter and the vessel
going out to sea. Only then it would be in a blue
flannel shirt open at the throat and in jack-boots.
But now, in the cabin of that yacht, dressed as he
was in black clothes like anybody else and in good-fitting
shoes, you had to take a second look at him
to get his measure. The yachtsman thought that
he and the skipper were of about the same size, and
barring that the skipper&rsquo;s shoulders were a shade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
wider there wasn&rsquo;t so much difference to look at.
But there was a difference, just the same. The
yachtsman weighed a hundred and seventy-five
pounds. He asked what Maurice weighed. &ldquo;Oh,
about the same,&rdquo; said Maurice. But I and Clancy
knew that he weighed a hundred and ninety-five,
and Minnie Arkell, who knew too, finally had to
tell it, and then they all took another look at the
two men and could see where the difference lay.
There was no padding to Maurice, and when
you put your hand where his shoulders and
back muscles ought to be you found something
there.</p>
<p>When we were leaving that night, Mrs. Miner
stopped Maurice on the gangway to say, &ldquo;And
when they have the fishermen&rsquo;s race this fall, you
must sail the Johnnie Duncan, Maurice, as you&rsquo;ve
never sailed a vessel yet. With you on the quarter
and Clancy to the wheel she ought to do great
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll race her as well as we know how if
we&rsquo;re around, but Tom O&rsquo;Donnell and Wesley
Marrs and Tommie Ohlsen and Sam Hollis and
the rest&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;ll have something to say about it,
I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it? You&rsquo;ve got the vessel and you
must win&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll bet all the loose money I have in
the world on her. Remember I own a third of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
her. Mr. Duncan sold me a third just before I
left Gloucester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a surprise to us&ndash;&ndash;that Mrs. Miner
owned a part of the Johnnie Duncan. It set Clancy
to figuring, and turning in that night, he said&ndash;&ndash;he
was full of fizzy wine, but clear-headed enough&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Well,
what do you make of that? The Foster
girl a third and Minnie Arkell a third of this one.
I&rsquo;m just wise to it that it wasn&rsquo;t old Duncan alone
that wanted Maurice for skipper. Lord, Lord,
down at the Delaware Breakwater do you remember
that when we heard that the Foster girl owned
a part of this one, I said, like the wise guy I thought
I was, &lsquo;Ha, ha,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;so Miss Foster owns a
third? That&rsquo;s it, eh?&rsquo; And now it&rsquo;s Minnie
Arkell a third. Where does Withrow come in?
And did you hear her when she invited Maurice to
the time they&rsquo;re going to have on that same steam-yacht
to-morrow night?&ndash;&ndash;that was when she whispered
to him at the gangway, when we were leaving.
She tried to get him to promise to come, and
at last he said he would if he was in the harbor.
&lsquo;Then be sure to be in the harbor&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re skipper
and can do as you please. Do come,&rsquo; she said at
the last, good and loud, &lsquo;and tell them how to sail a
vessel in heavy weather. They only play at it, so
do come and tell them.&rsquo; And then in a low
voice&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;But I want you to come for yourself.&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
That&rsquo;s what she says&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;For yourself,&rsquo; she says&ndash;&ndash;in
a whisper almost. &lsquo;Take a run into the harbor to-morrow
night if you can, Maurice,&rsquo; she says. O
Lord, women&ndash;&ndash;women&ndash;&ndash;they don&rsquo;t know a thing&ndash;&ndash;no,&rdquo;
and Clancy turned in.</p>

<h3>THE SKIPPER PUTS FOR HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>We were out of Newport Harbor before daybreak
of next morning, and cruised inside
Block Island all that day. We all thought the
skipper would be in to Newport that night&ndash;&ndash;it
was no more than a two hours&rsquo; run the way the
wind was&ndash;&ndash;and we waited.</p>
<p>The test came after supper. We had supper as
usual, at three o&rsquo;clock. Breakfast at four, dinner
at ten, supper at three&ndash;&ndash;mug-ups before and after
and in between. Along about four o&rsquo;clock the
skipper, standing on the break, stood looking back
toward where Newport lay. Had we turned then
we&rsquo;d have been in nicely by dark. It was a fine
afternoon&ndash;&ndash;the finest kind of an afternoon&ndash;&ndash;a clear
blue sky, and a smooth blue sea with the surface
just rippling beautifully. All fire was the sun and
the sails of every vessel in sight looked white as
could be. Several yachts passed us&ndash;&ndash;steam and sail&ndash;&ndash;all
bright and handsome and all bound into Newport,
and the skipper&rsquo;s eyes rested long on them&ndash;&ndash;on
one of them particularly with music aboard.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>The skipper looked back a long time&ndash;&ndash;looked
back, and looked back. He began walking the
quarter&ndash;&ndash;back and forth, back and forth, back and
forth. The sun got lower and lower, the sea lost
some of its blue, and the air grew fresher, and still
he kept looking back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a grand sunset to-night, Tommie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The finest kind. But one thing wrong with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not seeing it astern of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper stopped. &ldquo;Astern? That&rsquo;s so, too&ndash;&ndash;it
<i>is</i> a fine westerly, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy said nothing, only leaned against the rigging,
not a move out of him&ndash;&ndash;puffing his pipe and
looking away.</p>
<p>Nobody spoke till the skipper spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to the wheel&ndash;&ndash;you, Steve? How&rsquo;s she
heading now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;the by west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;the by west? Put her east by no&rsquo;the&ndash;&ndash;ease
off your mainsheet. Let it go to the knot. Call
the gang and make sail&ndash;&ndash;stays&rsquo;l and balloon&ndash;&ndash;everything&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll
go home, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy snapped the pipe out of his mouth and
hove it over the rail. Then he went for the forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le
gangway. In two jumps he was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, you loafers&ndash;&ndash;on deck and make sail. &lsquo;To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the east&rsquo;ard,&rsquo; says the skipper, and over the shoals
we&rsquo;ll put her to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home! Home&ndash;&ndash;good enough&ndash;&ndash;and hurroo!&rdquo;
we could hear from below.</p>
<p>The skipper said nothing more&ndash;&ndash;only all night
long he walked the quarter.</p>
<p>Next day when we were almost abreast of Cape
Cod Clancy began to instruct me. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a tip
for any girl friends you got, Joe. See the skipper
last night? Tell them if they&rsquo;re after a man&ndash;&ndash;a
real man&ndash;&ndash;even if he&rsquo;s a bit shy&ndash;&ndash;tell them&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
Oh, the advice that Clancy could give!</p>
<p>About the time that we left Cape Cod light
astern and squared away for Thatcher&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;with
Gloucester Harbor almost in sight&ndash;&ndash;with the rocks
of Eastern Point dead ahead&ndash;&ndash;Clancy began to
sing again:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a deep blue sky and a deep blue sea</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>And a blue-eyed girl awaiting me&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Too-roo-roo and a too-roo-ree&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Who wouldn&rsquo;t a Gloucester seiner be?</p>
</div></div>
<p>Ha, Joey-boy?&rdquo; and gave me a slap on the shoulder
that sent me half-way to the break.</p>
<p>That was all right, but I went aloft so I could
see the rocks of Cape Ann a mite sooner. I was
just beginning to discover that I had been almost
homesick.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>
<h3>SEINERS&rsquo; WORK</h3>
</div>
<p>We were high line of the seining fleet when
we got home from the Southern cruise and
we felt pretty proud of ourselves. It was something
to stand on the corner on one of the days
when the Johnnie was fitting out again, and have
other fellows come up to you and say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that they say you fellows shared on the Southern
trip?&rdquo; And when we&rsquo;d tell them, and we trying
not to throw out our chests too much, it was fine
to hear them say, &ldquo;That so? Lord, but that&rsquo;s
great. Well, if Maurice only holds out he&rsquo;ll make
a great season of it, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll hold out,&rdquo; we&rsquo;d say, and lead the way
down to the Anchorage or some other place for a
drink or a cigar, for of course, with the money
we&rsquo;d made, we naturally felt like spending some
of it on those who were not doing so well. And of
course, too, no seiner could ever resist anybody who
talks to him in a nice friendly way like that.</p>
<p>The skipper&rsquo;s doings ashore interested all of his
crew, of course, although me, perhaps, more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
anybody else, unless it was Clancy. I got pretty
regular bulletins from my cousin Nell. She was
for the skipper, first, last and all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; she said to me more than a dozen
times. &ldquo;I do like him, but I never imagined that
a man who does so well at sea could shrink into
himself as he does. Why, you almost have to haul
him out by the ears ashore. If it weren&rsquo;t for me I
really believe&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and she stopped.</p>
<p>But I thought I understood what she meant.
&ldquo;Meaning your chum, Alice Foster?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, meaning my chum, Alice Foster. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Sometimes I think she&rsquo;s a
kind of a frost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t a frost, and don&rsquo;t you come
around here again and tell me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did I, for I would not have an argument
with Nell for all the Alice Fosters in the world,
for if Nell were anybody else but my first cousin,
I think I would have fallen in love with her myself.</p>
<p>And then we put out to sea and again we were
living the life of seiners, having it hard and easy in
streaks. There were the times when we went along
for a week and did not do a tap but eat, sleep,
stand a trick at the wheel, a watch to the mast-head,
and skylark around the deck, and read, or
have a quiet game of draw or whist or seven-up
below. But again there were times when we were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
on fish, and our skipper being a driver, it was
jump, jump, jump for a week on end. There was
that time in August when the fish were so plentiful
on Georges Bank, when, standing to the mast-head,
you could see nothing but mackerel schooling
for fifteen or twenty miles either side of the vessel.
But, oh, they were wild! A dozen times we&rsquo;d
heave the seine&ndash;&ndash;put off from the vessel, put out
that two hundred and odd fathom of twine, drive
seine-boat and dory to the limit, purse in&ndash;&ndash;and
not so much as a single mackerel caught by the
gills. That happened fifteen or twenty times some
days, maybe. We got our fill of sets that month.
But then again there was a week off Cape Cod and
in the Bay of Fundy and off the Maine coast when
we ran them fresh to Boston market, when we
landed more mackerel it was said in a single week
than was ever landed before by one vessel. We
were five days and five nights that time without seeing
our bunks. It was forever out and after them,
heave the seine, purse up and bail in, ice some, and
dress the rest along the way, and the vessel with
everything on driving for Boston.</p>
<p>We stood to it that week, you may be sure, until
coming on the fifth day some of us fell asleep over
the keelers as the Johnnie was coming into T
Wharf. I remember that I could just barely see
in a kind of a hazy way the row of people along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
cap-log when we made fast. And yet after that
we had to hoist them out of the hold and onto the
dock. That day, going out again, the skipper
made all but the watch and himself turn in. That
afternoon, when everybody had had a little kink,
the skipper himself, who had been under a heavier
strain than any of us, suddenly fell backward over
the house and sound asleep. And there he lay all
the rest of that day and that night.</p>
<p>After ten or twelve hours of it we tried to wake
him, but not a budge. We tried again, but no use.
At last he came to and without any help at all.
Sitting up, he asked where we were, and being told,
he said nothing for a moment or so, and then suddenly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;That
so? How long was I asleep?&rdquo; We
told him&ndash;&ndash;seventeen hours. &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he
groaned, and after a mug-up scooted for the mast-head
like a factory hand with the seven o&rsquo;clock
whistle blowing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fisherman, the skipper,&rdquo;
said the gang as they watched him climb the
rigging.</p>
<p>And he was a fisherman. All that summer he
drove things with but little time for us ashore.
Twice he put into Gloucester with a day to ourselves
and another time we had a chance to run
down after we had put into Boston for market,
and that we suspected was because the skipper
found he could not keep away himself any longer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Things, we judged, were going pretty well with
him in Gloucester. He did not pretend any longer
now that he was not interested in Miss Foster, and
from my cousin Nell I got occasional hints, most
of which I confided to Clancy, who explained them
as if they were so many parables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; said Clancy, &ldquo;if only Minnie
Arkell stands clear. I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s away for the
summer, but she&rsquo;ll turn up in the fall. You&rsquo;ll see
her just before the race large as life, and some of
her swell-dressed friends, and a yacht, I&rsquo;ll bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering how deeply the skipper was interested
in Miss Foster, some of us thought he ought
to be putting in a little time ashore between trips.
After a run into the Boston fresh fish market, say,
we would have liked mighty well to take in the
theatre, or a trip to the beach, or some other little
entertainment of a night. But no, it was in and
out&ndash;&ndash;drive, drive, drive.</p>
<p>He was all ambition, the skipper. He was going
to be up front or break something. Miss Foster
was one of the ambitious kind, too. If she was
going to have a fisherman, he would have to be a
killer or she would know why. And so I suppose
that had a lot to do with the way the skipper drove
things.</p>
<p>We had our loafing spells, as I say, but mostly
it was plenty of work. That time when we stayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
awake for five days and nights was not the only
one. Another time our legs swelled up and the
blood came out of the ends of our fingers with
standing up to the keelers and dressing fish without
rest. But, Lord, nobody minded that. After we&rsquo;d
got rested up we felt better than ever.</p>
<p>We had good luck generally. We lost neither
men nor gear to amount to anything that summer.
That seine we lost trying for our first school to the
s&rsquo;uth&rsquo;ard in the spring was the only bit of misfortune
that came, and we had long ago made up for
that. But others were not so lucky. There was
the loss of the Ruth Ripley, Pitt Ripley&rsquo;s vessel. I
think I have said that she was a fast vessel. She
was fast&ndash;&ndash;fast, but of the cranky type. We were
jogging along a little to windward of her one fine
afternoon&ndash;&ndash;it had been a fine September day and
now it was coming on to evening. To the westward
of Cape Sable, in the Bay of Fundy, it was, and no
hint of a blow up to within a few minutes of the
time when the squall struck the Ruth. I suppose
it would have been more prudent on Pitt&rsquo;s part if
he had had less sail on, but like most of the skippers
in the fleet I guess he was not looking for
any record for prudence. Any minute he might
have to be up and driving her, and keeping sail on
was the quickest way to have it when you needed it
in a hurry. The squall hit her&ndash;&ndash;it hit us, too, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
we saw it coming and met it and beyond washing
a few keelers overboard, when she rolled down, no
harm was done to the Johnnie. On the Ripley, I
suppose, they saw it too, but the Ripley and
the Duncan were not the same class of vessel
by any means. She went over&ndash;&ndash;hove down,
with her foremast under water to the cross-trees
almost.</p>
<p>Most of her crew were below at the time, some
in their bunks. Four or five of those below never
reached the deck at all&ndash;&ndash;the water rushing down
the companionways cut them off. Some rushed
aft where the stern was high out of water and some
piled into the rigging. Some were calling out and
giving advice to others. We could hear them
plainly. Two jumped to the wheel and threw it up,
but she would not right.</p>
<p>We had the Johnnie to keep right side up, but
we saw the whole thing. It could not have been
more than two or three minutes from the time the
squall struck her when she was going down head-first.
Those of her crew who had gone to the
stern were going with her, but those who had taken
to the rigging, by leaping wide came clear. Their
seine-boat, which had been towing astern, might
have been of use to them, but being fast to the vessel
by the painter it was pretty well filled with water
before anybody had a chance to cut the painter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
The man that cut it went down with the vessel. He
was all right, whoever he was. Those in the water
were looking about for the dory, and found that
half full of water, too. They were trying to bail
the water out of the dory, after hauling it across
the bow of the submerged seine-boat, when we got
them in our seine-boat and picked up what was left
of them.</p>
<p>Nine of them were lost, her skipper among
them. One of the men saved&ndash;&ndash;the cook&ndash;&ndash;said that
when the squall struck the vessel, Captain Ripley
had been seen to jump for the boom tackle, which
he unhitched, and then to spring for the lashings
of the dory, which he cut with his knife. The
cook also said that he thought the skipper lost his
life because of the half-stunning blow that he must
have received from the fore-boom while he was on
the rail trying to free the dory. The vessel was
sinking all the time and it being dark&ndash;&ndash;or near it
in the squall&ndash;&ndash;I suppose Captain Ripley could not
watch everything. No doubt, it was the fore-boom
hit him and knocked him overboard. Certainly
he was knocked overboard, and the last seen
of him he was swimming and pushing an empty
barrel before him to one of the crew. &ldquo;Keep
your nerve up,&rdquo; he called to the cook, and after
that he suddenly disappeared. He got a man&rsquo;s
death, anyway.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>We rowed back to the Duncan with the survivors.
Nine men gone&ndash;&ndash;it was a hard story to
take home with us, but we had it to do. It was all
a part of fishing life, and so we put back for
Gloucester.</p>

<h2>XXII</h2>
<h3>ON THE CAPE SHORE</h3>
</div>
<p>While we were into Gloucester, after taking
home the crew of the Ruth Ripley,
our vessel was put on the ways. That was after
a talk between the skipper and Mr. Duncan.
There is always something that needs attending
to on a fisherman, and this time it was our
water-tanks. And while they were being looked
after, the Johnnie was overhauled, her bottom
scrubbed and topsides painted. Old Mr. Duncan,
we found, was beginning to take a lot of pride in
our vessel and balked at no expense to have her in
trim. And now that the Ripley was lost, he would
have only two vessels to represent him in the big
fishermen&rsquo;s race, which was then only four weeks
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up home now,&rdquo; he said to Maurice as
we left the dock that time. &ldquo;Hurry up, and give
yourself plenty of time to tune her up and get her
in trim for the race. I&rsquo;ve set my heart on it. You
or the Lucy Foster must win that race, and whatever
else we do we&rsquo;ve got to beat Withrow&rsquo;s vessel,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>And Miss Foster said that one of her guardian&rsquo;s
vessels would have to win the race, and my cousin
Nell said that the Johnnie Duncan would have to
win. There was a lot depending on it, she said.
It meant a lot to Will Somers, I suppose Nell
meant.</p>
<p>We figured that we had time to make a Cape
shore trip, and, with fair luck, to fill the Johnnie
with salt mackerel and be back in time to get her
in good condition for the race, which this year, because
it was anniversary year in Gloucester, promised
to be the greatest ever sailed.</p>
<p>Our plans were somewhat interfered with by a
rescue we made. We found a Glasgow bark, New
York bound, in the Bay of Fundy, and her crew in
hard straits. We stood down and after a lot of
trouble took them off&ndash;&ndash;Clancy and Long Steve in
the dory. Billie Hurd came near being the second
man in the dory, but Clancy, grabbing him as he
had one foot over the rail, hauled him back with,
&ldquo;Way for your elders, little man,&rdquo; and jumped in
beside Long Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elders, but not betters,&rdquo; said Hurd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; answered Clancy,
&ldquo;but I go in the dory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rescue was really a fine thing, but the important
thing was that some of the rescued men
had been exposed to the battering of the sea so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
long that they needed medical attention, and so
we drove for home&ndash;&ndash;and cracked our foremast-head
doing it. That delayed us almost a week, for
the skipper had to have that spar just so. A lot
might depend on it, same as the rest of the gear.
And it was a spar&ndash;&ndash;as fine a bit of timber, Oregon
pine of course, as was ever set up in a fisherman.
And maybe that too was just as well, with the race
coming on.</p>
<p>By the time we were down the Cape shore&ndash;&ndash;down
Canso way&ndash;&ndash;and among the fleet again, we
had lost a week. Our hold was still to fill up, and
only two weeks and a day to the race. Wesley
Marrs, Tom O&rsquo;Donnell, Sam Hollis, and the rest
were then talking of going home and making
ready for the race. Bottoms would have to be
scrubbed, extra gear put ashore&ndash;&ndash;a whole lot of
things done&ndash;&ndash;and a few try-outs in the Bay by way
of tuning up.</p>
<p>The race was the talk of all the fleet. Half the
crews on the Cape shore wanted to be in Gloucester
when the race came off, and some of the skippers
of the slower vessels, which would not enter
because they had no show to win, were already
scheming to be home just before the race so that
they could be on hand to follow it.</p>
<p>The morning after we were back among the
fleet we got a small school right from under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
eyes of the Lynx, one of the English cutters which
were patrolling the coast to see that we didn&rsquo;t get
any fish within the three-mile limit. I remember
that while we were satisfied at the time that we
were outside the line, we did not know what the
revenue-cutter might say, and particularly the
Lynx, whose captain had a hard name among our
fleet for his readiness to suspect law-breaking when
there wasn&rsquo;t any. The cutter people generally
seemed to want to be fair toward us, but this
Lynx&rsquo;s captain was certainly a vindictive cuss.
Anything hailing from Gloucester was an abomination
in his eyes. And so this morning, when, after
we had decided that we were outside the limit,
and made ready to set, it was hard to have to take
the order of the Lynx and sheer off. Our judgment
of distance ought to have been as good as his&ndash;&ndash;better,
really, we thought it, because we were
always judging distances at sea, and more at home
upon the sea, too. But that made no difference&ndash;&ndash;what
the cutter people said had to be law for us.</p>
<p>So this time he ordered us not to set where we
were or he&rsquo;d seize our vessel. Several Gloucester
vessels had been confiscated just before this and the
owners had to pay the fine to recover them. One
owner disputed the judgment and his case was then
waiting settlement. Another who refused to pay
saw his vessel turned into a lightship and placed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
down Miramichi way in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
where it is yet. This day the commander of the
Lynx might have some reason to think that his
order ended that for us&ndash;&ndash;and we could almost see
him chuckling&ndash;&ndash;but it didn&rsquo;t. A fog was creeping
up at the time and in ten minutes it was on us, and
under cover of the fog we got a little school&ndash;&ndash;the
same school we thought and on the exact spot
where the cutter was lying when she ordered us off.
Didn&rsquo;t we cackle though when we bailed it in? Oh,
no! It was not much of a school&ndash;&ndash;only twenty
barrels&ndash;&ndash;but it made us all feel fine. Not alone did
we feel that we had got the better of the English
cutter, but also that luck was coming to us again.
We justified ourselves by saying that we honestly
believed we were outside the three-mile limit, and
that our judgment was as good as theirs.</p>
<p>That night the forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le of the Johnnie Duncan
presented one of the most beatific scenes I ever saw.
Everybody was in the temper of an angel. There
was nothing doing&ndash;&ndash;no whist at the table, no reading
out of upper bunks, no love song from the
peak, and no fierce argument on the lockers. We
were discussing the cutters and the talk was very
soothing. The cook, as usual, was finishing up a
batch of dough. You might have thought he was
the only man who had been working in a week,
were it not for the wet oil-clothes hanging up to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
dry, and the overhauling of second suits of oil-clothes
by some of the gang. Every man, except
the cook, who never smoked while at work, was
puffing away as if he misdoubted he would ever
get another chance for a pipeful in his life. &ldquo;Harmony
most ex-quis-ite,&rdquo; said somebody, and that&rsquo;s
what must have been that hung over the forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le,
and it seemed to be merely in keeping with the
heavenly order of things that the atmosphere
showed pale blue wherever the rays of the lamp
could get a chance to strike through.</p>
<p>When Clancy dropped down for his usual mug-up
before going to the mast-head for the night of
course, he wasn&rsquo;t going to let that get by without
having a word to say about it. He leaned against
the foremast and took a look around. &ldquo;My soul,
but it&rsquo;s as if the blessed angels were fanning their
wings over this forehold. There&rsquo;s Brian Boru
and Lord Salisbury there double-banked on the
same locker, and nothing doing on any Irish question.
There&rsquo;s the lad that sleeps in the peak and
not a single hallelujah of praise for his darling
Lucille. The other one&ndash;&ndash;the wild man that sings
the Bobbie Burns songs&ndash;&ndash;not a shriek out of him.
And Bill and John no longer spoiling their eyesight
on bad print. I expect it&rsquo;s that little school
of fish&ndash;&ndash;the first in two weeks or more. The prospect
must be making you all pleased. Well, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
ought. A few hundred barrels of that kind of
mackerel&ndash;&ndash;as fine fish as ever I see bailed over the
rail. And some of you ready reck&rsquo;ners ought to
easily figure up what&rsquo;ll be coming to us if we ever
fill her up&ndash;&ndash;say five hundred barrels. A good
thing&ndash;&ndash;a few hundred barrels of mackerel. A few
too many of &rsquo;em for good trim, but it&rsquo;s comforting
to know they&rsquo;re there. She seemed to be in
pretty nice trim when we tried out one or two of
the fleet this morning, didn&rsquo;t she? And to-night, if
it breezes up&ndash;&ndash;and it looks now as if it will&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll
get some more&ndash;&ndash;if it&rsquo;s a night like last night. One
time there last night&ndash;&ndash;did you notice her, cook?&ndash;&ndash;that
time that crazy lad started to cross our bow
and we luffed her. Why, man, she shot over like
I don&rsquo;t know what&ndash;&ndash;just shot like one of those
torpedo boats we see around when the Navy goes
evoluting. I was near shook overboard from aloft.
They tell me they&rsquo;re going crazy over the race in
Gloucester. Well, here&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;ll bet his summer&rsquo;s
earnings&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s left of it, you mean, Tommie,&rdquo; said
George Moore from his pan of dough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, what&rsquo;s left of it&ndash;&ndash;and what I c&rsquo;n
borrow. Old man Duncan&rsquo;ll stake me, and there&rsquo;s
others. I hope, though, it blows a jeesly gale. For
this one, God bless her, she c&rsquo;n sail, and some of
them&rsquo;ll find it out&ndash;&ndash;when it&rsquo;s too late, maybe. Sam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
Hollis for one. There&rsquo;s a man I&rsquo;d give my eye
almost, to beat. And maybe the skipper hasn&rsquo;t
got it in for him! He doesn&rsquo;t say much, Maurice
don&rsquo;t, but a while ago, after coming down
from aloft, Billie Simms hails him and tells him
that the cutter people know all about that little
school to-day&ndash;&ndash;and who told him, who told him?
Well, the skipper&rsquo;ll drive this one to the bottom
before he ever lets Sam Hollis or any of
Withrow&rsquo;s vessels get by him when we race. Yes,
sir. But, Georgie-boy&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Clancy shouldered away
from the foremast&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;how is it for a wedge or two
of one of those blueberry pies you got cooling
there? Just a little wedge, now. But you don&rsquo;t
need to be too close-hauled with your knife&ndash;&ndash;no.
Sailing by the wind is all right when you&rsquo;re
jogging in and out among the fleet, and nothing
partic&rsquo;lar doing except an eye out for mackerel,
but you want to give her a full always&ndash;&ndash;always,
Georgie&ndash;&ndash;when you&rsquo;re cutting pie. There&rsquo;s the
lad&ndash;&ndash;straight across the beam. And now at right
angles again. And now lay one atop of the other,
and you have it&ndash;&ndash;an invention of my own&ndash;&ndash;a
blueberry sandwich. M-m&ndash;&ndash;but look at the juice
squish through her scuppers!&rdquo; He held it up
for all of us to have a look. &ldquo;Now another little
wash of coffee in the wake of that and I&rsquo;ll be all
right for a fine little watch aloft.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>He jammed his sou&rsquo;wester hard down, and
heroically waved away the remainder of the pie.
&ldquo;No, no. First thing I know I&rsquo;ll be having dyspepsia.
I never had it yet, but I might,&rdquo; and then
heaved himself up the companionway, humming,
as he went, one of his old favorites:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the &rsquo;Liza Jane and the Maria Louise</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Sailed a race one day for a peck of peas.</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>You&rsquo;d hardly believe the way them two</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Carried sail that day&ndash;&ndash;they fairly flew.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>People ashore they said, &lsquo;Gee whiz!</p>
<p><span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>The &rsquo;Liza Jane the fastest is.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>We could hear him scrambling, still humming,
over the barrels on deck. He halted long enough
by the rail to say, &ldquo;How is it, boys?&rdquo; to the watch
on deck, and then swung himself up the rigging.
Once aloft he had his work cut out, with hours of
strain on brain and nerve. But Clancy never
minded&ndash;&ndash;he never minded anything so far as we
could make out.</p>

<h2>XXIII</h2>
<h3>DRESSING DOWN</h3>
</div>
<p>That night was the worst I ever put in towing
astern of a vessel. &ldquo;Owling&rdquo; is the seiners&rsquo;
word for that kind of work. It was &ldquo;owling&rdquo;
sure enough, with the seine-boat on a short painter
and the dory on a shorter painter still and astern
of the seine-boat again. We came near to being
lost in the dory. Mel Adams, who was in the dory
with me, thinking she was surely going to capsize
one time she rode up over the stern of the seine-boat,
took a flying leap into the seine-boat. He
had a hard time getting back, for there was quite
a little sea on. Even in the seine-boat they were
all glad enough to hear Clancy give the word to
cast off and pull after the school.</p>
<p>It was a big school, and hard work in that sea,
but we had them safe at last. The vessel then came
alongside and the bailing in began. Having had
a good long lay-off we bailed them in with plenty
of good-will. It was &ldquo;He-yew!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oy-hoo!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hi-o!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Drive her!&rdquo; all along the line until
we had on deck what the skipper thought was a
hundred barrels. Then the bag was put around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
the seine to protect the rest of the mackerel from
dogfish and sharks, and we were ready to dress.</p>
<p>Barrels were tossed out of the hold, keelers set
up, sharp-edged knives drawn from diddy-boxes
below, and a chance had to see a smart crew dressing
a haul of mackerel that were to be salted. It
was too long a run, four hundred miles or so, to
take a chance of getting them fresh to market. It
needed a fair and fresh breeze to be sure of it, and
besides with the market for salt mackerel getting
stronger all the time it was good judgment to salt
down and fill her up before going home.</p>
<p>We had been through the same thing before,
even with as good a deckload, but now we were
getting near the end of the season. This trip, then
the race, and maybe one more trip after the race,
and we would be done seining. And so we drove
things.</p>
<p>Four gangs of four men each took corners in the
waist. Each gang had two keelers&ndash;&ndash;yard square
boxes, eight inches or so in depth, and set up on
two or three barrels. Into the keelers the mackerel
on deck were bailed and around them the
men gathered, with long-handled torches set up all
about.</p>
<p>All hands came into the dressing&ndash;&ndash;skipper and
cook too&ndash;&ndash;and the work went on. It was one
gang against the other, each jealously counting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
barrels when they were filled, that full credit might
be given for speed. Sixteen men were accounted
for in this way. The seventeenth and eighteenth
were to keep the keelers filled, draw water for
pickle from over the side, roll the filled barrels out
of the way&ndash;&ndash;in short, to help out generally.</p>
<p>It was fine to watch the splitters. One left-handed
grab and the mackerel was in place; flat
and smooth, one right-handed slit and he was laid
open the length of his back. Forty-five mackerel
a minute either the skipper, Clancy or Moore could
split&ndash;&ndash;that is, pick them up, place in position, split
from nose to tail along the back, and slide out of
the way again. Sixty a minute they could do in
spurts, if somebody would place the mackerel in
rows for them.</p>
<p>The busiest man of all was the skipper. He had
to keep an eye out for the course of the Johnnie.
Vessels that are dressing fish, vessels on which the
entire crew are soaked in blood, gills, intestines, and
swashing brine, might be allowed privileges, one
might think; but no, they must keep a lookout
just the same. On this dark night, the Johnnie
Duncan, though making a great effort&ndash;&ndash;considering
that she had jibs down and wheel in the becket&ndash;&ndash;to
stay as she was put, yet would fall away or
come-to, especially when the wind shifted two or
three points at a jump. And just as soon as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
did the skipper would notice it instantly, jump aft
and set her right. Generally, to shift the wheel a
few spokes would be enough, but now and then he
would have to give the wheel a good round whirl.
At such a time he would sing out a warning, the
torches would be lowered, we would duck our
heads, the boom would go swinging by in the
smoky yellow glare, and the Johnnie Duncan would
be off on another tack. We would brace our legs
to a new angle, the skipper would hop back to his
knife, and again the dressing would go humming
along.</p>
<p>When we had the first hundred barrels of
mackerel swashing in brine, the rest of them, perhaps
another hundred barrels, were bailed in. And
all night long like that we stood to it driving.
Under the yellow and smoky light of the torches
I could see nothing but mackerel or the insides of
mackerel in the air. Keelers, deck, rail, our hands,
faces, boots and oilskins were sticky with the blood
and gurry. At top speed we raced like that
through the night. Once in a while a man would
drop his knife or snap off his gibbing mitt, rinse
his hand in the brine barrel by his side, slap his
hand across the hoops, and condemn the luck of a
split finger or a thumb with a fish-bone in it. Another
might pull up for a moment, glance up at
the stars or down at the white froth under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
rail, draw his hand across his forehead, mutter,
&ldquo;My soul, but I&rsquo;m dry,&rdquo; take a full dipper from
the water-pail, drink it dry, pass dipper and pail
along to the next and back to his work.</p>
<p>When the cook called out for breakfast we were
still at it, with the deck of the vessel covered with
barrels of pickling mackerel. It was beginning to
get light then. &ldquo;Oh, the blessed day&rsquo;s coming on.
Smother the torches, boys,&rdquo; said the skipper, and
led the way below for the first table to have a
bite.</p>
<p>Before the sun came up we were beginning to
make out the rest of the fleet. One after another
they were coming into view, their long hulls and
high spars reaching across the wind. Between the
gray sky and the slaty sea their white sails looked
whiter than chalk.</p>
<p>We had to name the different vessels then.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Tom O&rsquo;Donnell&ndash;&ndash;and Wesley Marrs&ndash;&ndash;and
Sam Hollis&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; sung out Andie Howe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam Hollis&ndash;&ndash;where&rsquo;s Sam Hollis?&rdquo; broke in
Mel Adams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away to the east&rsquo;ard, ain&rsquo;t it, Andie?&ndash;&ndash;the
fellow with jibs down?&rdquo; spoke up Billie Hurd, who
was a bit proud that he too could pick her out at
such a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mel, and he began to
tell our troubles in the dory. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas him near ran
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
over us last night&ndash;&ndash;remember, Joe? Leastways, it
looked like Hollis&rsquo;s new one&rsquo;s quarter goin&rsquo; by.
He was pointin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout no&rsquo;the-east then, but he
couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ve held on that tack long or he&rsquo;d be somewhere
up by Miquelon and not here this mornin&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;the
gait he was goin&rsquo;. Man, but there was smoke
coming out of his scuppers when he went by.
&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t y&rsquo; come aboard whilst you&rsquo;re about it&ndash;&ndash;come
aboard and be sociable,&rsquo; I hollers. &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t
cry, y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t hurted,&rsquo; says whoever&rsquo;s to the wheel
of her. Least it sounded like that, &lsquo;Y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t
hurted,&rsquo; he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been pretty close, Mel?&rdquo; said
Clancy, never stopping, but keeping a string of split
mackerel rolling into his keeler. Mel and I were
gibbing for Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close? I could&rsquo;ve touched his chain-plates like
that,&rdquo; and Mel, getting excited, reached his mittened
hand across the keeler and touched Clancy
on the arm. Clancy&rsquo;s knife took a jump and cut a
finger. For a few seconds Clancy laid down the
law of a splitting knife to Mel, but Mel didn&rsquo;t
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about the way I swore at the man
to the wheel of the Withrow. Didn&rsquo;t I, Joe?
Yes, sir, I cert&rsquo;nly swore at him good, but it no
more jarred him than&ndash;&ndash;but when their seine-boat
came by, half of &rsquo;em smokin&rsquo;, some half-breed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
among &rsquo;em has to sing out, &lsquo;Y&rsquo;ought to hang up a
riding light if your vessel&rsquo;s hove-to,&rsquo; he says.
What do you think of that, Tommie&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;if your vessel&rsquo;s
hove-to!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;and if the Johnnie was going one
she was going ten knots an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mel&ndash;&ndash;I heard you to the mast-head,&rdquo;
said Clancy. Clancy heard it about as
much as old Mr. Duncan back in Gloucester did,
but he was always ready to help a man out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you? Well, I hove-to him. I hove the
bailer at him, that&rsquo;s what I did, and he ducked.
But he ducked too late, I callate, for &lsquo;Bam!&rsquo; it
caught him&ndash;&ndash;or somebody in the seine-boat with
him. He swore some, or somebody swore, you c&rsquo;n
bet. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who y&rsquo;are,&rsquo; he hollers, &lsquo;but if
ever I meet you ashore,&rsquo; and he was so far away
then I couldn&rsquo;t ketch no more of it. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know
who y&rsquo;are, but if I ketch you ashore&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;Lord&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, if a lad with a bump on the side of his head
waltzes up to you on Main Street and whangs you,
Mel, next time you&rsquo;re ashore in Gloucester, what&rsquo;ll
you do?&rdquo; asked Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s that bailer, you loafer?&rsquo; but
first I&rsquo;ll whang him back. I had to finish the bailing
out with my sou&rsquo;wester. I sings out to Andie
Howe in the boat here to hand me one of the
bailers in the boat. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m usin&rsquo; my hat,&rsquo; I hollers,
&lsquo;and Joe&rsquo;s using his sou&rsquo;wester,&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; that would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
fetch him all right. &lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;re usin&rsquo; ten sou&rsquo;westers
here,&rsquo; says Andie, &lsquo;and one or two of &rsquo;em
leaks,&rsquo; and that was all the satisfaction I got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Eddie Parsons, &ldquo;the seine-boat was
sure wallerin&rsquo; then. The skipper had only just
told Jimmie Gunn to quit his growling. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
be wanting hot-water bags to your feet next, I
suppose,&rsquo; says the skipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of the boat&ndash;&ndash;afraid she&rsquo;d be
so logy with the water in her that we couldn&rsquo;t drive
her when the time came,&rdquo; bristled up Jimmie Gunn
to that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yah!&rdquo; snorted Eddie, &ldquo;if you weren&rsquo;t scared,
then I never saw a man scared. Logy? I notice
we made her hop along all right after we cast off
from the vessel. Man, but she fair hurdled some
of them seas&ndash;&ndash;some of the little ones, I mean.
Didn&rsquo;t she, Steve? We thought we&rsquo;d lost Joe and
you, Mel, in the dory, didn&rsquo;t we, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, hey? Well, you didn&rsquo;t, nor nowheres
near it,&rdquo; broke in Mel. &ldquo;We were right there with
the goods when they hove the seine, warn&rsquo;t we,
Joey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it went on through all that day, while
the men worked, dressing, salting, and putting all
in pickle. It was a drive all through without any
quitting by anybody, except when it was time to
relieve lookouts at the mast-head. In the middle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
of it all, had the call of &ldquo;School-O!&rdquo; been heard
from aloft, we would have been only too glad to
drop everything, jump into the boat and dory, get
after the mackerel, and do the same thing over&ndash;&ndash;split,
gibb and pack away&ndash;&ndash;for all of the next
night, and the night after that&ndash;&ndash;for a week if
necessary.</p>
<p>Not until well into the afternoon, when the last
mackerel was flattened out in its barrel, did any of
us feel that we could step back in our own time,
straighten ourselves out, and take a look over our
work. Then we counted the oozing barrels with
great satisfaction, you may be sure, even while we
were massaging our swollen wrists with our aching
fingers. It was a good bit of work that, well and
quickly done, and it was fine to get a rest after it,
although it might be only for a little while. Even
though we had to do it all over again&ndash;&ndash;to stay
half-drowned and chilled through in the seine-boat
or dory for half the night and then dress down for
eighteen or twenty hours on top of it&ndash;&ndash;what did
a little hard work matter? &ldquo;Think of the hundred-dollar
bill, maybe, to be carried home and laid in
the wife&rsquo;s lap,&rdquo; said Long Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the roaring night ashore when a fellow&rsquo;s
not a family man&ndash;&ndash;m-m&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; said Eddie Parsons.
Eddie was not a family man.</p>

<h2>XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE WITHROW OUTSAILS THE DUNCAN</h3>
</div>
<p>We certainly were feeling pretty good along
about that time, and we felt better when
next day, cruising in and out among the fleet,
other crews began to take notice of our catch. By
that time the word had gone around. One after
another they came sailing up&ndash;&ndash;as if to size us up
was the last thing that could enter their heads&ndash;&ndash;rounding
to, and then a hail. Something like this
it went:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloh, Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloh, Wesley,&rdquo; or George Drake, or Al
McNeill, or whoever it might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mighty pretty deckload of fish.
When&rsquo;d y&rsquo;get &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, twenty barrels yesterday morning and the
rest last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so? How many d&rsquo;y&rsquo;call &rsquo;em, Maurice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many? Oh, two hundred and eighty or
ninety wash barrels. Ought to head up about two
sixty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so? Fine, Maurice, fine. As handsome
a deckload as I&rsquo;ve seen this year.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>And he would bear off, and another vessel would
come and go through the same ceremony. It was
very satisfying to us and the skipper must have
felt proud. Not that a lot bigger hauls had not
been made by other men before&ndash;&ndash;indeed, yes, and
by the very men perhaps who were complimenting
him. But three hundred barrels, or near it, in
pickle at one time does look fine on a vessel&rsquo;s deck,
and they looked especially fine at this time because
there was not another vessel in the fleet that had
half as many, so far as we knew.</p>
<p>Not another but Sam Hollis&ndash;&ndash;or so he claimed.
He came ranging up that same day and began asking
how the Duncan was sailing lately, and followed
that up by saying he himself had two hundred
odd barrels in the hold. He showed about
sixty wash barrels on deck. We did not believe
he had twenty below. She looked cork light.
&ldquo;If she sets as high out of water with two hundred
and forty barrels, then you ought to put two
hundred and forty more in her and she&rsquo;d fly,&rdquo;
called out Clancy to Hollis, and that was pretty
much what we all thought.</p>
<p>And &rsquo;twas Sam Hollis made trouble for the
Duncan that day. He bore off then but came back
in the afternoon. More talk there was, and it
wound up by our racing with him. We did not
start out to race, but gradually, as we found ourselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
jogging along side by side, jibs were drawn
away and sheets began to be trimmed. The first
thing we knew we found ourselves swaying up sails,
and then before we really woke up to it we were
both off and away before a little breeze.</p>
<p>Hollis had all the best of it. He was bound to,
with the Duncan carrying most of her mackerel
aft and away down by the stern. Even had we had
time to&ndash;&ndash;we did shift some of it forward&ndash;&ndash;we
were too deep for any kind of racing in that moderate
breeze. We said that to ourselves, anyway,
and yet we held on. But it was no use&ndash;&ndash;it wound
up by Hollis giving us a scandalous beating. And
after running away from us he kept straight on
to the westward, and by that we knew that he was
bound for Gloucester to get ready for the big
race.</p>
<p>The skipper felt it. He was one that took things
to heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been bragging about this one&ndash;&ndash;what she
could do. I told the old man only the last time we
were in that he could go broke that I&rsquo;d beat Sam
Hollis, and here the first time we come together
he makes her look like a wood-carrier. The best
thing I can do, I guess, is to keep out of the race;
maybe it will save the old man some money. I expected
he&rsquo;d beat us, the trim we were in&ndash;&ndash;but to
beat us the way he did!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>Nothing the crew could say seemed to make him
think otherwise, and that night it was not nearly
so joyful below in the Johnnie Duncan. The talk
was that she would not go home for the race. Only
Clancy seemed to be as cheerful as ever. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
any of you get to worrying,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know the
skipper&ndash;&ndash;the Johnnie Duncan&rsquo;ll be there when the
time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet next morning when Wesley Marrs went by
us with the Lucy Foster bound for home and sang
out, &ldquo;Come along, Maurice, and get ready for the
race&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll have a brush on the way,&rdquo; our skipper
only waved his hand and said, &ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;this old plug
can&rsquo;t sail.&rdquo; Wesley looked mighty puzzled at
that, but kept on his way.</p>

<h2>XXV</h2>
<h3>TROUBLE WITH THE DOMINION CUTTERS</h3>
</div>
<p>Next day after, in a calm, Clancy and I had
to take the dory and row out among the
fleet for some salt. The skipper thought it likely
that some of the vessels that were going home
might have salt to spare. He doubted if he himself
would have enough in case we struck another
good school. So we rowed out. We went from
one vessel to another without any luck, until we
found ourselves aboard Tom O&rsquo;Donnell&ndash;&ndash;the
Colleen Bawn. And just as we got aboard a school
showed near by her, and they made a dash for it.
The Colleen was pretty well inshore then, and yet
safe outside the three-mile limit in our judgment.
Even in the judgment of one of the Canadian
revenue cutters, the Mink, she was outside the
limit. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, go ahead,&rdquo; her commander
sang out from the bridge.</p>
<p>Yet trouble came of it. The Colleen&rsquo;s gang
were making a set when along came the Lynx, the
same cutter that had ordered our own skipper not
to set two or three days back in the fog, and we had
set in spite of him. I think I said that he had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
bad reputation among our fleet. In this case some
said afterwards that he had been watching the
Duncan since that time, and having seen a dory put
out from her and go aboard Tom O&rsquo;Donnell, that
he then had a special watch for O&rsquo;Donnell. Anyway,
we know that as the Colleen Bawn&rsquo;s crew
were pursing in the seine he came along and ordered
them to cast loose the fish. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re inside
the limit,&rdquo; said this fellow now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be, but I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Donnell
to that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re inside and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar if you say I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Donnell had had trouble with the Lynx before,
and had small patience with her captain.
More words came out of it, and while they were
talking back and forth another of the fleet a mile
to the east&rsquo;ard put out a boat.</p>
<p>The cutter went after him, her captain singing
out as he went, &ldquo;You wait here till I come back.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wait like hell!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Donnell, &ldquo;and this breeze
making,&rdquo; and continued to purse up. Pursed up,
the fish aboard&ndash;&ndash;there were forty or fifty barrels&ndash;&ndash;he
started off. One of those sudden breezes were
springing up and it promised to be wind enough
to suit anybody. We made out the Johnnie Duncan
bearing down, intending no doubt to take off
Clancy and me. But the cutter was coming toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
us then, and O&rsquo;Donnell said we had better stay
aboard or we would be picked up on the way by
the cutter&rsquo;s people and maybe get the Duncan and
our skipper into trouble. That last&ndash;&ndash;the thought
that our skipper or the vessel might get mixed up
in it&ndash;&ndash;kept us aboard the Colleen Bawn.</p>
<p>The Lynx could steam as fast as any cutter they
had on the Cape shore at that time, but the Colleen
was a witch and O&rsquo;Donnell a wonder at sailing
her. So we stayed with O&rsquo;Donnell and
watched him and the cutter have it out. They had
it, the cutter letting drive a shot every once in a
while. The first shot, I remember, went whistling
by the ear of one of O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s crew who was
standing back-to in the waist, and so astonished
him, he not expecting it, that he fell into the forehold.
He raised a great racket among a lot of
empty barrels. The fall never hurt him, but
the things he said when he came on deck
again! O&rsquo;Donnell made him lie flat&ndash;&ndash;and then all
of us but Clancy, who refused to lie down but compromised
by leaning over the house and watching
the cutter and making comments on her actions for
the benefit of the rest of us. Through it all O&rsquo;Donnell
stood to the wheel and the nearest he came to
honoring the cutter by a compliment was when he&rsquo;d
half turn his head, spit over the rail and swear at
her. The wind and sea-way together were too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
much for the cutter. The Colleen left her behind,
and she at last drew off after bunching a few farewell
shots.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Donnell then hove-to and took his seine-boat
on deck. He had been towing it the wrong end
foremost for the whole forty miles, and he was
worried over it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strained her maybe&ndash;&ndash;and
she almost a new boat,&rdquo; he lamented. &ldquo;For the
rest I don&rsquo;t care. That lad had it in for me all
along. The other one though, he&rsquo;s decent&ndash;&ndash;never
bothers a man without a little reason. I was going
home anyway for the race, and so it don&rsquo;t matter.
I suppose Maurice will be along soon, Tommie?
Did you see him coming after the cutter&ndash;&ndash;he held
her fine and he in no trim. What&rsquo;s it they say
about Hollis beating the Johnnie yesterday? If he
did, be sure he was specially prepared, and the
Johnnie had an off-day. But I suppose he&rsquo;ll be
holding on now for Gloucester?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy said maybe, but no telling, and explained
how it had been&ndash;&ndash;the skipper&rsquo;s discouragement
after Hollis had beaten him.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Donnell said he was foolish to worry over a
thing like that. &ldquo;I know Sam Hollis,&rdquo; he said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;&rsquo;twas
a trap he laid for Maurice. He&rsquo;s got a
smart vessel in the Withrow, but he can&rsquo;t run away
from Maurice. No, nor beat him I doubt&ndash;&ndash;with
both in trim. But wait a while&ndash;&ndash;let the day of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
race get near and Maurice to thinking it over, and
you&rsquo;ll see him flyin&rsquo; home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We hoped so. For ourselves we went home on
the Colleen. There was nothing else for us to do.
We had quite a time of it that trip with O&rsquo;Donnell.
He sailed about five hundred miles out of
his way&ndash;&ndash;away to the eastward and s&rsquo;uth&rsquo;ard.
There might be cruisers and cutters galore after
him, he said&ndash;&ndash;they might put out from Halifax,
or telegraph ahead&ndash;&ndash;you couldn&rsquo;t tell what they
might do, he said, and so he sailed the Colleen out
to sea. But we came across the Bay one dark night
without side-lights, and reached Boston all right.
O&rsquo;Donnell had a suit of sails stowed away in an
East Boston wharf that he wanted to get out for
the race. And also he didn&rsquo;t like his new foremast
and was going to have a new one put in if
there was time.</p>

<h2>XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE GOSSIP IN GLOUCESTER</h3>
</div>
<p>Clancy and I went home by train, reaching
Gloucester as the first of an easterly gale
set in. There we found it was nothing but talk of
the race. We had not reached Main Street at all
before Clancy was held up. Clancy, of course,
would know. Where was Maurice Blake? What
were we doing in Gloucester and the Johnnie not
in? The Duncans&ndash;&ndash;especially the elder Mr. Duncan&ndash;&ndash;Miss
Foster, my cousin Nell, and Will
Somers were boiling over. Where was Maurice
Blake? Where was the Johnnie Duncan? Everybody
in town seemed to know that Sam Hollis had
given us a bad beating down Cape shore way, and
the news had a mighty discouraging effect on all
Maurice&rsquo;s friends, even on those of them who
knew enough of Sam Hollis not to take his talk
just as he wanted them to take it. Withrow&rsquo;s vessel
had beaten the Johnnie Duncan with Maurice
Blake sailing her&ndash;&ndash;they had to believe that part of
it, and that in itself was bad enough. Sam Hollis&rsquo;s
stock was booming, you may be sure&ndash;&ndash;and the
race right close to hand, too.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That little beating the Johnnie got didn&rsquo;t lose
any in the telling by Sam Hollis and his gang, did
it, Joe?&rdquo; said Clancy to me, and then he went
around borrowing all the money he could to bet
the Johnnie Duncan would beat the Withrow in
the race. But would Maurice now enter at all? I
asked Clancy about that part&ndash;&ndash;if there was not a
chance that Maurice might not stay down the Cape
shore way and let the race go. But he only
laughed and said, &ldquo;Lord&ndash;&ndash;Joey-boy, you&rsquo;ve a lot
to learn yet about Maurice in spite of your season&rsquo;s
seining along with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a Monday morning when Clancy and I
reached Gloucester. The race was to be sailed
on Friday of that same week. For several days
before this, we were told, Wesley Marrs, Sam
Hollis, Tommie Ohlsen, and the rest of them had
been out in the Bay tuning up their vessels like a
lot of cup defenders. Never before had fishermen
given so much attention to the little details before
a race. The same day that we got home they were
up on the ways for a final polishing and primping
up. They were smooth as porcelain when they
came off. And coming off their skippers thought
they had better take some of the ballast out of
them. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t as if it was winter weather&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;it
was the middle of September then&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;with big seas
and driving gales,&rdquo; was the way Wesley Marrs put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
it, and they all agreed that the chances were ten
to one that the wind would not be strong enough
to call for the heavy ballast they carried. Fishermen,
of course, are built to be at their best when
wind and sea are doing their worst, and so the
taking out of ballast for a September race looked
like good judgment. So about forty tons of ballast
were taken out of most of them&ndash;&ndash;the Lucy
Foster, the Withrow, the Nannie O, and half a
dozen others.</p>
<p>That looked all right, but on Tuesday night an
easterly gale set in, the wind blowing forty-odd
miles an hour. All day Wednesday it blew, and all
day Thursday even harder, with a promise of blowing
harder still on Friday, which was to be the day
of the race. The people of Gloucester who had
been praying for wind, &ldquo;Wind for a fisherman&rsquo;s
race&ndash;&ndash;wind&ndash;&ndash;wind,&rdquo; seemed likely to get what
they wanted.</p>
<p>On Thursday I saw Tommie Ohlsen and Wesley
Marrs in conference on the street. Wesley had
his nose up in the air, sniffing the breeze. He
shook his head with, &ldquo;Tommie, I ought to&rsquo;ve let
the ballast stay in the Lucy. It looks like it&rsquo;s going
to be the devil&rsquo;s own breeze for vessels that ain&rsquo;t
prepared for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ohlsen, &ldquo;wind fifty-two mile an
hour the weather man says, and still making.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
That&rsquo;s bad for light ballast and whole sail. If we
could only put the ballast back&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;if we could. But we can&rsquo;t put it back
now&ndash;&ndash;there ain&rsquo;t time to do it right and everybody
would laugh at us too. And besides, if we did, all
the others would put it back, and where&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Tommie, &ldquo;but if all of us
would put it back it would make a better race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In view of the reputation of Wesley Marrs and
Ohlsen and O&rsquo;Donnell and their vessels, we could
not understand the confidence of Withrow and his
people in Sam Hollis. He had a great vessel&ndash;&ndash;nobody
doubted it. But it was doubted by many
if she was the equal of some of the others, and
few believed she was better. And Sam Hollis was
not the man to carry the sail, or at least the fishermen
of Gloucester generally did not think so. But
Withrow and Hollis&rsquo;s gang kept on bragging and
they backed their bragging up, too. I drew what
money I had saved that summer out of my seining
share&ndash;&ndash;two hundred and twenty-five dollars&ndash;&ndash;and
bet it myself with one of the Withrow&rsquo;s crew that
the Johnnie Duncan would beat the Withrow,
whether the Johnnie was home to race or
not. It was really betting against Withrow himself,
who, it was said, was taking up every bet
made by any of the Withrow&rsquo;s crew. That was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
Thursday afternoon, and still no word of the
Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Joey,&rdquo; said Clancy when he
heard of that. &ldquo;Even if Maurice don&rsquo;t come it&rsquo;s
better to lose your money and shut them up. But
don&rsquo;t worry&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;ll come. Do you think he&rsquo;s been
standing and looking at this easterly&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s all along
the coast to Newf&rsquo;undland I see by the papers&ndash;&ndash;and
not swing her off? He&rsquo;s on his way now, and
swinging all he&rsquo;s got to her, I&rsquo;ll bet. Wait and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My,&rdquo; said my cousin Nell, &ldquo;and so you bet
your pile on the Johnnie Duncan whether she&rsquo;s in
or not?&ndash;&ndash;and if she don&rsquo;t reach here in time you
lose it all?&rdquo; and told it all over to her Will
Somers, to whom I learned she was now engaged.
And from that time on I noticed that Alice Foster
beamed on me like an angel.</p>
<p>Minnie Arkell was home for the race just as
Clancy had prophesied. She had come with some
of her friends down from Boston three or four
days before this, in the same steam-yacht she had
been aboard of at Newport in June. Meeting me
she asked me about our passage home on the Colleen
Bawn, and I told her of it. She listened with
great interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Tom O&rsquo;Donnell as fine-looking as he used
to be&ndash;&ndash;with his grand figure and head and great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
beard? I remember some years ago I used to
think him the finest-looking man I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her that I guessed she&rsquo;d think him fine-looking
yet if she&rsquo;d seen him to the wheel of the
Colleen Bawn with the six-pound shot whistling
by him, and he never so much as letting on he knew
they were there. Her eyes shone at that. Then
she offered to take any bets I made off my hands.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t afford to take your little savings out of
the bank and bet it on a vessel that may not be
here in time. I&rsquo;ll take it off your hands&ndash;&ndash;come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was an attractive side to her&ndash;&ndash;caring but
little for money&ndash;&ndash;but I wasn&rsquo;t letting anybody
take my bets off my hands. I still believed that
Maurice would be home, though that was seven
o&rsquo;clock Thursday evening. I knew he would be
home if he only guessed that his friends were betting
on his vessel&ndash;&ndash;and they not even knowing
whether she was to be home in time for the race.
And if he weren&rsquo;t home, I was ready to lose my
little roll.</p>

<h2>XXVII</h2>
<h3>IN CLANCY&rsquo;S BOARDING-HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>From Minnie Arkell, whom I met at the
door of her own house, I went to Clancy&rsquo;s
boarding house. I did not find Clancy then and I
went off, but coming back again I found him, and
a very busy man he was, with an immense crock
of punch between his knees. He was explaining
down in the kitchen to the other boarders&ndash;&ndash;fifteen
or twenty of the thirstiest-looking fishermen I ever
laid eyes on&ndash;&ndash;just how it was he made the punch.
The bowl was about the size of a little beer keg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the night of last Fourth of July,&rdquo; he was
saying&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and I mind we came in that morning
with a hundred and seventy-five barrels we got off
Mount Desert&ndash;&ndash;that night I warn&rsquo;t very busy. I
gets this crock&ndash;&ndash;four gallons&ndash;&ndash;let you all have a
look&ndash;&ndash;a nice cold stony crock you see it is, and
that they&rsquo;d been using then in the house here for
piccalilli&ndash;&ndash;and a fine flavor still hanging to it.
Wait a minute now till I tell you. It&rsquo;ll taste better,
too, after you hear. And into the crock I puts
two gallons of rum&ndash;&ndash;fine rum it was&ndash;&ndash;for a bottom.
Every good punch has to have a bottom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
It&rsquo;s like the big blocks they put under a house by
way of a foundation, or the ballast down near the
keel of a vessel&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;d be no stiffening without
it, and the first good breeze she&rsquo;d capsize, and then
where&rsquo;d you be? Now, on top of those two gallons&ndash;&ndash;it
was two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, I mind,
when I started to mix it&ndash;&ndash;whiskey, brandy, and
sherry&ndash;&ndash;no, I can&rsquo;t tell what parts of each&ndash;&ndash;for
that&rsquo;s the secret of it. A fellow was dory-mate
with me once&ndash;&ndash;a Frenchman from Bordeaux&ndash;&ndash;told
me and said never to tell, and I gave my oath&ndash;&ndash;down
in St. Peer harbor in Miquelon it was&ndash;&ndash;and
afterwards he was lost on the Heptagon&ndash;&ndash;and of
course, never being released from the oath, I can&rsquo;t
tell. Well, there was the rum, the whiskey, the
brandy, and the sherry&ndash;&ndash;and on top o&rsquo; that went
one can of canned pine-apple&ndash;&ndash;canned pine is better
than the pine-apple right out of its jacket.
Why? Well, that&rsquo;s part of the secret. Then a
dozen squeezed lemons and oranges. Then some
maraschino. I&rsquo;d got it off an Italian salt bark skipper
in the harbor once. On top o&rsquo; that I put one
quart of green tea&ndash;&ndash;boiled it myself&ndash;&ndash;it was three
in the morning then, I mind&ndash;&ndash;and I sampled a cup
of it. Wait now&ndash;&ndash;wait. Just ease your sheets and
let me tell it. Here&rsquo;s the best part of it. I takes
that crock with the fourteen quarts of good stuff
in it and lowers it to the bottom of the old well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
out in the yard with a lot of cold round little
stones above and below and more little stones
packed all around and then I lowers down two
good-sized rocks on top o&rsquo; that&ndash;&ndash;and nails boards
over the well&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s why nobody could get into
that well all this summer. Well, that was the
morning after the last Fourth of July&ndash;&ndash;I mind the
sun was coming up over the rocks of Cape Ann
when I was done. And that was July, and now the
last of September&ndash;&ndash;three months ago. A while ago
in the dark and a howling gale&ndash;&ndash;you all see me
come in with it, didn&rsquo;t you? Yes, if you go out
quick, you c&rsquo;n see the well just where I left it&ndash;&ndash;I
goes out and digs it up&ndash;&ndash;and here it is&ndash;&ndash;and
now it&rsquo;s here, we&rsquo;ll all have a little touch in
honor of to-morrow, for it&rsquo;s a great day when the
wind blows fifty or sixty miles an hour so that
fishermen can have good weather for a race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they all had a little touch. Clancy sat on
the table with the crock between his feet and bailed
it out while they all agreed it was the smoothest
stuff that ever slid down their throats. There was
not a man in the gang who was not sure he could
put away a barrel of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put away a barrel of it?&rdquo; whispered Clancy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;yes.
Let&rsquo;s get out of here, Joe. In an hour they&rsquo;ll
be going into the air like firecrackers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XXVIII</h2>
<h3>IN THE ARKELL KITCHEN</h3>
</div>
<p>We left Clancy&rsquo;s boarding house and went
over to old Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s place, where
most of the skippers who were going to race next
day had gathered. Clancy at once started in to
mix milk-punches. And he sang his latest favorite,
with the gang supping his mixture between the
stanzas:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hove flat down on Quero Banks</p>
<p>Was the Bounding Billow, Captain Hanks,</p>
<p>And the way she was a-settlin&rsquo; was an awful sight to see&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Then Wesley Marrs sang a song and after him
Patsie Oddie followed with a roarer.</p>
<p>The punch-mixing, singing and story-telling
went on and in the middle of it Tom O&rsquo;Donnell
came driving in. He was like a whiff of a no&rsquo;the-easter
out to sea. &ldquo;Whoo!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hulloh,
Wesley-boy&ndash;&ndash;and Patsie Oddie&ndash;&ndash;and Tommie
Ohlsen&ndash;&ndash;and, by my soul, Tommie Clancy again.
Lord, what a night to come beating down from
Boston! What&rsquo;s that, Wesley?&ndash;&ndash;did the Colleen
outfoot the cutter down the Cape shore way? Indeed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
and she did, and could do it over again in the
same breeze to half their logy old battleships.
Into Boston I was Monday morning, and the fish
out of her the same morning. Tuesday I took her
across to Cape Cod, tuning her up, and into Provincetown
that night. Next day it was blowing
pretty hard. A fine day for a run across the Bay,
I thinks, and waits for maybe a Boston vessel, one
of the T Wharf fleet. For I&rsquo;ll go to Boston, I
thinks, to put the Colleen on the railway to-day,
because maybe in Gloucester I may have to wait&ndash;&ndash;or
may get no chance at all&ndash;&ndash;with half a dozen
or more that will be waiting to be scrubbed for the
race. And who comes along then but Tom Lowrie.
&lsquo;Waiting for me?&rsquo; he asks, and I tells him I was
hoping it would be the new Whalen vessel.
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s as good as any Whalen vessel,&rsquo;
he says&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;as good as anything out of Boston&ndash;&ndash;or
Gloucester,&rsquo; he says. So across the Bay we had
it out. And, gentlemen, I&rsquo;m telling you the Colleen
sailed&ndash;&ndash;all the wind she wanted. She came
along, and Lowrie&ndash;&ndash;by the looks of things then&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
sailing yet. Well, I never did like that
forem&rsquo;st that was in the Colleen, and so, thinks I,
here&rsquo;s a chance to test it&ndash;&ndash;and why not, with the
race coming on? So I jibed her over off Minot&rsquo;s
just&ndash;&ndash;and sure enough it cracked about ten feet
below the mast-head.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You were satisfied then, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and I was. And better before the race
than in the race. And next day&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s to-day&ndash;&ndash;we
spent putting in a new stick. I had to take
what I could get to save time, and I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s what it ought to be and maybe it won&rsquo;t last
through to-morrow. But, anyway, you want to
have an eye out for the Colleen to-morrow, for I&rsquo;m
telling you I never see her sail like she did yesterday
coming across the Bay. Ask Tom Lowrie
next time you see him. Well, to-night I had to
beat down here to be sure and be here in time, and
so out we put&ndash;&ndash;and here I am. Blowing? Indeed
and it is. And thick, is it? Standing on her
knight-heads and looking aft you c&rsquo;d no more
than make out her side-lights. We came along,
and Boston inner and outer harbor crowded with
vessels, steamers and sail, waiting for it to moderate
so they c&rsquo;d put out. A blessed wonder it was
we didn&rsquo;t sink somebody&ndash;&ndash;or ourselves. Outside
we went along by smell, I think, for only every
once in awhile could we see a light. One time we
almost ran into something&ndash;&ndash;a fisherman it must
have been, for I s&rsquo;pose only a fisherman would be
going in on a night like this&ndash;&ndash;out of a squall of
snow and blackness she came&ndash;&ndash;man alive! but,
whoever she was, she was coming a great clip.
Winged out and we didn&rsquo;t see her till the end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
her bowsprit caught the end of our main-boom&ndash;&ndash;hauled
in we were to two blocks&ndash;&ndash;and over we
went on the other tack&ndash;&ndash;yes, sir, over on the other
tack. Thinks I, &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a new way to jibe a vessel
over.&rsquo; And the end of her fore-boom all but swept
me from beside the wheel and over the rail as she
went by&ndash;&ndash;she was that close. And I sings out to
her, &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you leave us your name so I can thank
you next time we meet?&rsquo; but Lord, not a word out
of him. He kept on to Boston, I suppose, and we
kept on to Gloucester, and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Colleen, Tom&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, man? Watch her to-morrow. Barring
that forem&rsquo;st being too light&ndash;&ndash;but whoever looked
for a breeze like this?&ndash;&ndash;two days and three nights
now and blowing harder all the time. But never
mind, she&rsquo;ll make great going of it to-morrow.
Divil take it, but we&rsquo;ll all make great going of it.
Tommie, dear, what&rsquo;s in the bowl? Milk? Man,
but don&rsquo;t be telling me things like that&ndash;&ndash;and the
one thing the doctors warn me against is heart-trouble.
Ah, milk-punch&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s better, man. A
wee droppeen. Look at it&ndash;&ndash;the color of the tip of
a comber in twelve fathom of water and a cross-tide.
Well, here&rsquo;s to every mother&rsquo;s son of us
that&rsquo;s going to race to-morrow. May ye all win
if the Colleen don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;all but you, Sam Hollis. But
where&rsquo;s he gone&ndash;&ndash;into the other room? Well, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
he was here &rsquo;twould be the same. He&rsquo;s got a vessel
that can sail. Let him sail her to-morrow and win,
if it&rsquo;s in her&ndash;&ndash;or in him. But a thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;and
outside my house and vessel, Lord knows, it&rsquo;s
all the money I&rsquo;ve got in the world&ndash;&ndash;beyond my
house and vessel&ndash;&ndash;a thousand dollars the Colleen
beats the Withrow. Hello, there&ndash;&ndash;what d&rsquo;y&rsquo;say,
Sam Hollis&ndash;&ndash;the Colleen and the Withrow&ndash;&ndash;a
thousand dollars, boat for boat. But where the
divil is he? Gone? Are you sure? Gone! But
a queer time to leave a party&ndash;&ndash;just when it&rsquo;s getting
to be real sociable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the betting now, Tom,&rdquo; spoke up
Wesley Marrs. &ldquo;Let the owners have that to
themselves. And according to accounts some of
them are having it. Fred Withrow and old Duncan
are ready to go broke over the race to-morrow.
Whichever loses, he&rsquo;ll remember this race, I&rsquo;m
thinking. Here&rsquo;s hoping it won&rsquo;t be Duncan. So
to the devil with the betting, Tom. Some of us
have bet all we could afford&ndash;&ndash;some of us more
than we could afford, I callate. Let&rsquo;s have a song
instead, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything to please you, Wesley,&rdquo; and O&rsquo;Donnell
began to sing. He started off first with his</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, seiners all and trawlers all,&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>but Alec McNeill and Patsie Oddie interrupted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
&ldquo;Oh, give us the other one, Tom&ndash;&ndash;the Newf&rsquo;undland
and Cape Shore Men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; laughed O&rsquo;Donnell, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the mention of
your own you want&ndash;&ndash;you and Patsie there. Well,
it&rsquo;s all one to me. Any man from any place, so
long as he&rsquo;s a fair man and a brave man, and Lord
knows ye&rsquo;re both that. Well, here&rsquo;s to you both&ndash;&ndash;a
wee drop just, Tommie&ndash;&ndash;easy&ndash;&ndash;easy,&rdquo; and he
began:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Newf&rsquo;undland and Cape Shore men, and men of Gloucester town,</p>
<p>With ye I&rsquo;ve trawled o&rsquo;er many banks and sailed the compass roun&rsquo;;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ate with ye, and bunked with ye, and watched with ye all three,</p>
<p>And better shipmates than ye were I never hope to see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen ye in the wild typhoon beneath a Southern sky,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen ye when the Northern gales drove seas to mast-head high,</p>
<p>But summer breeze or winter blow, from Hatt&rsquo;ras to Cape Race,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to see ye with the sign of fear upon your face.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, swingin&rsquo; cross the Bay</p>
<p>Go eighty sail of seiners,</p>
<p>And every blessed one of them a-driving to her rail!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gale upon the waters and there&rsquo;s foam upon the sea,</p>
<p>And looking out the window is a dark-eyed girl for me,</p>
<p>And driving her for Gloucester, maybe we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>What the little ones are thinking when the mother looks out so.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>Oh, the children in the cradle and the wife&rsquo;s eyes out to sea,</p>
<p>The husband at the helm and looking westerly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>When you get to thinking that way, don&rsquo;t it make your heart&rsquo;s blood foam?</p>
<p>Be sure it does&ndash;&ndash;so here&rsquo;s a health to those we love at home.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>West half no&rsquo;the and drive her, we&rsquo;re abreast now of Cape Sable,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an everlasting hurricane, but here&rsquo;s the craft that&rsquo;s able&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>When you get to thinking that way, don&rsquo;t it make your heart&rsquo;s blood foam?</p>
<p>Be sure it does&ndash;&ndash;so here&rsquo;s a health to those we love at home.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, the roar of shoaling waters and the awful, awful sea,</p>
<p>Busted shrouds and parting cables, and the white death on our lee;</p>
<p>Oh, the black, black night on Georges when eight score men were lost&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Were ye there, ye men of Gloucester? Aye, ye were&ndash;&ndash;and tossed</p>
<p>Like chips upon the water were your little craft that night,</p>
<p>Driving, swearing, calling out, but ne&rsquo;er a call of fright.</p>
<p>So knowing ye for what ye are, ye masters of the sea,</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to ye, Gloucester fishermen, a health to ye from me.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And here&rsquo;s to it that once again</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll trawl and seine and race again;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to us that&rsquo;s living and to them that&rsquo;s gone before;</p>
<p>And when to us the Lord says, &lsquo;Come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll bow our heads, &lsquo;His will be done,&rsquo;</p>
<p>And all together let us go beneath the ocean&rsquo;s roar.&ldquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>I never again expect to hear a sea song sung as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Tom O&rsquo;Donnell sang it then, his beard still wet
with the spray and his eyes glowing like coal-fire.
And the voice of him! He must have been heard
in half of Gloucester that night. He made the
table quiver. And when they all rose with glasses
raised and sang the last lines again:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s to it that once again</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll trawl and seine and race again;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to us that&rsquo;s living and to them that&rsquo;s gone before;</p>
<p>And when to us the Lord says, &lsquo;Come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll bow our heads, &lsquo;His will be done,&rsquo;</p>
<p>And all together we shall go beneath the ocean&rsquo;s roar&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>any stranger hearing and seeing might have understood
why it was that their crews were ready
to follow these men to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The like of you, Tom O&rsquo;Donnell, never sailed
the sea,&rdquo; said Patsie Oddie when they had got the
last ro-o-ar&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;even the young ladies come in off
the street to hear you better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He meant Minnie Arkell, who was standing in
the doorway with her eyes fixed on O&rsquo;Donnell,
who had got up to go home, but with Wesley trying
to hold him back. He was to the door when
Minnie Arkell stopped him. She said she had
heard him singing over to her house and couldn&rsquo;t
keep away, and then, with a smile and a look into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
his eyes, she asked O&rsquo;Donnell what was his hurry&ndash;&ndash;and
didn&rsquo;t he remember her?</p>
<p>In her suit of yachting blue, with glowing face
and tumbled hair, she was a picture. &ldquo;Look at
her,&rdquo; nudged Clancy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t she a corker? But
she&rsquo;s wasting time on Tom O&rsquo;Donnell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your hurry, Tom?&rdquo; called Wesley.
&ldquo;Another song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s the little woman on the hill. She
knew I was to come down to-night and not a wink
of sleep will she get till I&rsquo;m home. And she knows
there&rsquo;ll be bad work to-morrow maybe and she&rsquo;d
like to see me a little before I go, and I&rsquo;d like to
see her, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a lucky woman, Captain O&rsquo;Donnell, and
you must think a lot of her?&rdquo; Minnie Arkell had
caught his eye once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that she&rsquo;s so awfully lucky with
me on her hands,&rdquo; laughed O&rsquo;Donnell, &ldquo;but I do
think a lot of her, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child? to me? But you don&rsquo;t remember me,
Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and I do, and well remember you.
And it&rsquo;s the beautiful woman you&rsquo;ve grown to be.
But you always were a lovely child. It&rsquo;s often my
wife spoke of you and wondered how you were.
She&rsquo;s heard me speak of your father a hundred
times, I know. A brave man your father, girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
And she&rsquo;ll be glad to see you any time, little girl&ndash;&ndash;or
the daughter of any fisherman lost at sea. If
ever you have a blue day, go to her, for &rsquo;tis she has
the heart&ndash;&ndash;and, God bless her, an extra weakness
for orphans. Her own children some day&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s
no telling. But good-night to you, dear&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
patted her head&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;good-night all. Wesley, Tommie,
Patsie&ndash;&ndash;all of ye, good-night. In the morning
we&rsquo;ll have it out.&rdquo; Out the door he went, and
I fancied there was almost a blush on Minnie
Arkell&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Tom O&rsquo;Donnell was the kind of a man a fellow
would like to have for a father.</p>

<h2>XXIX</h2>
<h3>MAURICE BLAKE COMES HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>From Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s we walked back to
Clancy&rsquo;s boarding house. Clancy wanted to
see how they made out with the punch. We found
several of them up in the wind, and so no great
danger of them. But two or three of them,
Dave Campbell particularly, were running wild.
&ldquo;Boomed out and driving,&rdquo; said Clancy, and began
to remonstrate with Dave on the evils of intemperance.
He went on quite awhile, but Dave
showed no signs of remorse. &ldquo;Wait and I&rsquo;ll fix
him,&rdquo; said Clancy, and obeying a motioning with
his head two or three of the sober ones followed
him out.</p>
<p>He led the way to the wood-shed next door
where there was a goat, and the goat we carried
up three flights of stairs to Campbell&rsquo;s room. He
was a big, able goat, and we had quite a time to get
him up stairs. At last we got him tied to the post
of Campbell&rsquo;s bed. Then we went down stairs to
the kitchen and Clancy persuaded Campbell to go
up stairs to bed, which after awhile he did. It was
not yet morning and there was no light in the bedroom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
We took our position on the landing outside
where we could hear everything that went on
in Campbell&rsquo;s room, which was just at the head of
the stairs.</p>
<p>Dave went in and we could hear him falling over
something in the dark. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; we could
hear him, and acting as if he was feeling around.
Taking off our shoes we crawled nearer. We could
barely make out his shadow in the dark, but we
could easily hear him talking to himself. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
it? Eh, what?&rdquo; He must have been feeling the
horns then, and the goat must have butted him.
Again, and once more, for out the door and down
the stairs went Dave. We ran in and cut the goat
loose and down he went after Dave. The whole
three flights they raced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got me at last,&rdquo; hollered Dave, bolting
into the kitchen, slamming the door behind him and
bracing himself against it.</p>
<p>We took the goat and put him back in the wood-shed
and came back to the kitchen by way of the
window. Dave, who was still braced against the
door, did not know but what we had been in the
kitchen all the time, and that gave Clancy a fine
chance to take up his lecture on intemperance just
where he had left it off,&ndash;&ndash;at the very beginning.
&ldquo;Intemperance, Dave, is an awful thing. You&rsquo;ll
have to be doing something for it soon, I think.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Yes, when the devil himself gives you a call it&rsquo;s
time to do something. You&rsquo;d better come with me
and take the pledge. Come up now to Father
Haley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Pres&ndash;&ndash;a Pres&ndash;&ndash;a Pres&ndash;&ndash;by&ndash;&ndash;ter&ndash;&ndash;ian,
Tommie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come with me to your church then&ndash;&ndash;any
church at all. What&rsquo;s the odds, so long&rsquo;s you reform.
Here, we&rsquo;ll do it right here now. Come,
hold up your hand,&rdquo; and then and there Clancy was
about to get Dave to promise not to look a glass
of liquor or punch in the face for a year again,
when who comes bouncing in but Eddie Parsons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurroo!&rdquo; said Clancy, forgetting Dave and
grabbing Eddie by the shoulder, &ldquo;and the Duncan&rsquo;s
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; said Eddie, &ldquo;and four hundred and
fifty barrels of mackerel coming out of her hold.
A dozen lumpers getting &rsquo;em out from both holds
and two at a lick they&rsquo;re coming onto Duncan&rsquo;s
Dock. And what d&rsquo;y&rsquo;think, Tommie&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what kept you so long, man? We&rsquo;ve all
been getting heart disease waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. We ought to&rsquo;ve been in yesterday
mornin&rsquo;, or in the afternoon at the latest, for we
swung her off Tuesday night midnight&ndash;&ndash;plenty of
time with a fair wind. But on Wednesday afternoon,
coming like a race-horse&ndash;&ndash;wung out&ndash;&ndash;we
sighted a dory and two men in it signalizing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
Astray they were, and we took &rsquo;em aboard, and all
that night we stood by. And warn&rsquo;t it chafing?
Oh, no! Daylight came thick and we waited for
it to clear, keeping the horn goin&rsquo;. It lifted and we
got another dory, but it was late afternoon then.
Then their vessel came along with all the others
accounted for, and we turned over our two and
went on our way. And maybe she didn&rsquo;t come!
Oh, no! Blowing? A living gale all the time, but
the skipper kept her going. You&rsquo;d hardly b&rsquo;lieve
if I told you where we was yesterday afternoon and
we here now. A no&rsquo;the-easter and a howler all the
way. At four o&rsquo;clock we passed in by the bell-buoy.
Man, such a blow! Are we in the race, you
say? Are we! And oh, the skipper says for you
and Joe to be down after breakfast. We all knew
you&rsquo;d get home and be all right with Tom O&rsquo;Donnell.
So be down after breakfast&ndash;&ndash;the skipper will
be looking for you both. But say, let me tell you.
What d&rsquo;y&rsquo;think? Coming into the harbor a while
ago who d&rsquo;y&rsquo; s&rsquo;pose was out in the stream with a
lighter alongside his vessel? Who but Sam Hollis
and the Withrow. Yes, and the gang putting
ballast back in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And some one of them sees us going by
in the dark. And we did go by, too! &lsquo;Lord!&rsquo; says
somebody&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;twas Withrow himself&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;but if that
don&rsquo;t look like the ghost of Maurice Blake&rsquo;s vessel!&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; hollers back the skipper&ndash;&ndash;and they
must&rsquo;ve been some surprised to hear him&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;and
the ghost&rsquo;ll be with you to-morrow in the race.
Yes,&rsquo; the skipper says, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;re all ready for it.
Four weeks since we&rsquo;ve been on the ways and maybe
a scrubbing wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her, but if it keeps
a-blowin&rsquo; who&rsquo;ll mind that? Not the Johnnie.&rsquo;
Oh, Tommie, if you&rsquo;d seen her comin&rsquo; across the
Bay of Fundy yesterday afternoon and last night.
Did she come?&ndash;&ndash;did she come? Lord&ndash;&ndash;O
Lord&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so that&rsquo;s Withrow&ndash;&ndash;got his vessel tuned
up like a fiddle and now he&rsquo;s putting extra ballast
in her. Blast him and Hollis for schemers!&rdquo; said
Clancy. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how it comes they&rsquo;re so ready
to bet&ndash;&ndash;stiffenin&rsquo; her so stiff for to-morrow that
they know something&rsquo;ll happen to the others first.
But the Johnnie&rsquo;s a bit stiff, too&ndash;&ndash;and there&rsquo;s no
ballast out of her. And, as the skipper says,
maybe we ain&rsquo;t been on the ways for a few weeks
now, but Lord, the Johnnie ought to be able to
drag a few little blades of sea-grass on her hull in
this breeze. And so we&rsquo;re in the race, heh? Dave,
I can&rsquo;t stop to give you the pledge now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, the Johnnie Duncan fast and able,</p>
<p>Good-by, dear, good-by, my Mabel.&ldquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>And Clancy was the joyful man as he awoke the
echoes in the gray of that stormy morning.</p>

<h2>XXX</h2>
<h3>THE MORNING OF THE RACE</h3>
</div>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the people of Gloucester
will ever forget the morning of that race,
which, they will still tell you, was the only race
ever sailed. Wind was what the fishermen wanted,
and they got it&ndash;&ndash;wind, and sea with it. The admiral
of the White Squadron, then at anchor at
Rockport Harbor, just around the Cape, stood on
the bridge of his flagship that morning and looked
out to sea. Somebody told him that the fishermen
were going to race that day. He took another
look. &ldquo;Race to-day? Pooh! they&rsquo;ll do well to
stay hove-to to-day.&rdquo; Of course, that ought to
have settled it, the admiral having said it.</p>
<p>It blew that day. Leaving home I had time for
a bite to eat and a wash-up. I turned the corner
and picked up Clancy, with Maurice Blake, Tom
O&rsquo;Donnell and Wesley Marrs just ahead. We ran
into Mr. Edkins, a nice old gentleman, who had
been made secretary of the race committee. What
he didn&rsquo;t know about fishing would be the making
of a &ldquo;killer,&rdquo; but, of course, he wasn&rsquo;t picked out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
for that&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;d never fished a day in his life&ndash;&ndash;but
because of his knowledge of the rules of yacht
racing. Having had long experience in managing
yachting regattas, he knew all about time allowances
and sail measurements&ndash;&ndash;though there were
to be no allowances of any kind here. It was to be
boat for boat in this race; every vessel for herself.
So he was thought to be a good man to have to
look after the stake and judges&rsquo; boats. It was
Gloucester&rsquo;s Anniversary celebration, with a lot of
strangers in town&ndash;&ndash;the Governor and a whole
holdful of national characters&ndash;&ndash;and in deference
to them the race was to be managed so that spectators
might have a chance to see it.</p>
<p>Mr. Edkins came along in his official regalia&ndash;&ndash;tall
hat, frock coat, umbrella, gloves, and a pink
in his button-hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Captain O&rsquo;Donnell, that the race is
going to be held to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Donnell looked at him as though he didn&rsquo;t
understand. &ldquo;To-day? to-day?&ndash;&ndash;Good Lord, are
we all on the wrong tack? And sure isn&rsquo;t this the
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;oh, yes, Captain O&rsquo;Donnell, this is
the day appointed. And that is the trouble.
Surely you are not going to race to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; broke in Wesley Marrs,
&ldquo;and why aren&rsquo;t we going to race to-day? What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
in the name of all that&rsquo;s good have we been doing
with our vessels up on the railway the last week or
two? What d&rsquo;y&rsquo;think we took the ballast out of
our vessels for? What d&rsquo;y&rsquo;think I had that everlasting
new balloon made for last trip in, what for
that big mains&rsquo;l that Tom here had bent on the
Colleen yesterday, and for what did Maurice drive
the Johnnie Duncan home only last night? What
in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Captain, wait. What I mean is, do you
know how it is outside? They&rsquo;ve telegraphed me
that up in Boston Harbor there won&rsquo;t be a steamer
leave the harbor to-day&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s as stormy as that.
There are two big ocean liners&ndash;&ndash;and we&rsquo;ve got
word that they won&rsquo;t leave&ndash;&ndash;won&rsquo;t dare to leave&ndash;&ndash;not
a steamer of any kind will leave Boston Harbor
to-day. And outside a heavy sea running&ndash;&ndash;with
the wind fifty-four miles an hour, the weather
bureau says. Fifty-four miles an hour. That&rsquo;s not
street corner talk&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s official. And&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divil take it, does being official make it blow
any harder?&rdquo; asked O&rsquo;Donnell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know the way you fishermen will try
to carry on. I know, I know&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re
careful. I tell you, Captain O&rsquo;Donnell, and you,
Captain Marrs, I tell you all&ndash;&ndash;that if you persist
in racing to-day I wash my hands of the whole
affair&ndash;&ndash;completely wash my&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis a fine wash day, too. Come, Wesley&ndash;&ndash;come,
Maurice, we&rsquo;ll have to be getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left Mr. Edkins standing there. A little
farther on they overtook the manager of the insurance
company, which had policies on most of
the fishing vessels. He was just about to enter his
office when O&rsquo;Donnell spied him. &ldquo;Hullo, there&rsquo;s
the man I want to see&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and hailed, &ldquo;Just heave
to a minute, Mr. Brooks, if you please. Now look
here, you know we&rsquo;ve took a few pigs of iron out
our vessels, and you know it looks like a bit of
weather outside. Now, what I want to know is
if I capsize the Colleen Bawn to-day&ndash;&ndash;if I don&rsquo;t
come home with her&ndash;&ndash;does my wife get the insurance?
That&rsquo;s what I want to know&ndash;&ndash;does my
wife get the insurance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks looked at O&rsquo;Donnell, rubbed his
chin and scratched his head, then looked at O&rsquo;Donnell
again. &ldquo;Why, I suppose it all comes under the
usual risk of fishing vessels. I suppose so&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;h-m&ndash;&ndash;it
will be pretty risky, won&rsquo;t it? But let me
see&ndash;&ndash;wait a moment now&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s the President inside,
and Mr. Emerson, too&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s a director.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went inside, and we could see that they were
talking it over. Pretty soon they all came out
with the President of the company in front.
&ldquo;Good-morning, Captain O&rsquo;Donnell&ndash;&ndash;Captain
Marrs, good-morning. How do you do, Maurice?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
Captain O&rsquo;Donnell, take it from me as
official, your insurance on the Colleen Bawn is
safe. For the honor and glory of old Gloucester
go ahead and sink her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lucy Foster?&rdquo; asked Wesley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lucy Foster, Captain Marrs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the Johnnie Duncan, speaking for
the owners?&rdquo; asked Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For every vessel that we insure that leaves the
harbor to race to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurroo!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Donnell. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me,
Wesley, I&rsquo;m no&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s it?&ndash;&ndash;dip-lo-mat. Yes,
dip-lo-mat, by the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it certainly was a desperate morning for a
race. The streets seemed to be full of men ready
to go out. There were to be only nine vessels
in the race, but another half dozen vessels were
going over to see it, and that meant more than
three or four hundred able fishermen going out.
The men that were going to stay ashore would
go up to those that were going out and say,
&ldquo;Well, good-by, old man. If you don&rsquo;t come
back, why, you know your grave&rsquo;ll be kept green.&rdquo;
And the men going out would grin and say,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, boy, but if she goes, she&rsquo;ll go
with every rag on her,&rdquo; in a half-joking way, too,
but it was the belief that morning that there might
be a whole lot of truth in that kind of joking.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>Before we reached the dock we knew that the
whole town had learned pretty much that half a
dozen of the skippers had promised each other in
Mrs. Arkell&rsquo;s kitchen the night before, &ldquo;No sail
comes off except what&rsquo;s blown off,&rdquo; and there
promised to be some blown off. Men who had
only just heard their skippers speak of that were
bragging of it in the streets. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said one of
O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s crew as we were coming down the
dock, &ldquo;if any crawly-spined crawfish loses his nerve
and jumps to our halyards, thinkin&rsquo; the Colleen&rsquo;s
going to capsize&ndash;&ndash;why, he&rsquo;ll get fooled&ndash;&ndash;and
why? Because our halyards are all housed aloft&ndash;&ndash;by
the skipper&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That sounded strong, but it was true. When
we reached the end of our dock we looked for
ourselves, and there it was. The Colleen&rsquo;s crew
had hoisted their mains&rsquo;l already and there she lay
swayed up and all ready, and men aloft were even
then putting the seizing on. Tom O&rsquo;Donnell himself
was pointing it out to Sam Hollis with a good
deal of glee, thinking, I suppose, to worry Hollis,
who, to uphold his reputation, would have to do
the same and take the chances that went with it.
By this time everybody knew that Hollis had put
his ballast back during the night. One of Wesley
Marrs&rsquo;s men jumped onto the Withrow and below
and had a look for himself. He couldn&rsquo;t get down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
by way of the hatches&ndash;&ndash;they were battened down&ndash;&ndash;but
he dropped into the forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le and, before
anybody knew what he was up to, he had slipped
through the forehold and into the mainhold and
there he saw where they had hurriedly put back
the flooring, and he also saw extra barrels of sand
tiered low for further stiffening of the Withrow.
He was discovered before he got on deck and
nearly beaten to a jelly before he got up on the
wharf again. It ended in a fine little riot with
some of our gang and O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s mixing in.
Clancy came down the back-stay like a man falling
from the mast-head, so as to be into it before it was
over. He was almost too late&ndash;&ndash;but not quite.
Only old Mr. Duncan coming along with half a
dozen other dignified owners stopped it. But there
was time for Clancy to speak his mind out to Sam
Hollis. And that gave Hollis a chance to say,
&ldquo;Well, talk away, Tommie Clancy, but this is the
day I make the Johnnie Duncan take in sail.&rdquo; And
Clancy answered him, &ldquo;That so! Well, no matter
what happens, put this down, Maurice Blake hangs
to his canvas longer than Sam Hollis to-day&ndash;&ndash;hangs
to it or goes over with it or the spars come
out of the Johnnie Duncan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the talking was over we thought Hollis
would be shamed into sending a man aloft to mouse
his halyards too. But not for Hollis. That was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
a little too much for him. Clancy and three or
four others finished attending to our own halyards
and overhauling the gear aloft. Our mains&rsquo;l was
already hoisted and the other three lowers with
stops loosed were all ready to hoist too. The
mains&rsquo;l had been left standing just as it was when
the Johnnie Duncan came in that morning. It was
flat as a board, and I remember how grieved we
were when we had to lower it again because the tug
that came to give us a kick out from the dock could
not turn us around with it up&ndash;&ndash;it was blowing so.
The tug captain said he might manage to turn it
against the sun, but that would be bad luck of
course, and he knew the crew wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it,
especially with a race like this on hand. It had to
be with the sun; and so we had to lower it again,
and when the vessel was turned around, hoist it
again, not forgetting to lash the halyards aloft
again too. But after we&rsquo;d got it swayed up it
didn&rsquo;t set near so well as before&ndash;&ndash;too baggy to our
way of thinking.</p>

<a name='XXXI_THE_START_OF_THE_RACE' id='XXXI_THE_START_OF_THE_RACE'></a>
<h2>XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE START OF THE RACE</h3>
</div>
<p>We got away at last and beat out the harbor
with the Lucy Foster, the Colleen Bawn,
the Withrow, the Nannie O, and four others. For
other company going out there was a big steam-yacht
with Minnie Arkell and her friends aboard,
which did not get out of the harbor. Out by the
Point they shipped a sea and put back, with Minnie
Arkell waving her handkerchief and singing out&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
take in any sail, Maurice,&rdquo; as they turned
back. There was also the Eastern Point, a high-sided
stubby steamer, at that time running regularly
to Boston; and there was the New Rochelle, a
weak-looking excursioner that might have done for
Long Island Sound, where somebody said she&rsquo;d
just come from, but which didn&rsquo;t seem to fit in
here. Her passengers were mostly fishermen&ndash;&ndash;crews
of vessels not in the race. There was also a
big powerful iron sea-tug, the Tocsin, that promised
to make better weather of it than any of the
others.</p>
<p>Billie Simms was one of the men who were not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
going in the race but intended to see some of it.
He was in the Henry Clay Parker, a fine-looking
vessel that was not so very fast, but had the reputation
of being wonderfully stiff. Coming out past
Eastern Point lighthouse, where he could begin
to get a look at things, Billie hollered out that he
was sorry he hadn&rsquo;t entered. &ldquo;Looks to me like the
vessel that&rsquo;ll stay right side up the longest ought
to win this race, and that&rsquo;s the Henry C.&rdquo; He
hauled her across our stern while he was yelling and
I remember she took one roll down to her sheer
poles when passing on, and Maurice sang out,
&ldquo;Look out, Billie, or you&rsquo;ll capsize her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capsize this one? Lord, Maurice, I&rsquo;ve tried
it a dozen times and I&rsquo;m damned if I could,&rdquo; and
he went rolling on like nothing I ever saw, unless
it was the rest of us who were then man&oelig;uvring for
the start. We passed the Parker again before we
got to the line, and old Peter Hines, who was
hanging to her main-rigging, had to yell us his
good wishes. &ldquo;Drive her, Maurice-boy, and whatever
you do don&rsquo;t let the man that took your
vessel from you beat you home,&rdquo; meaning Sam
Hollis of course. Maurice waved his hand, but
said nothing. He was looking serious enough,
however.</p>
<p>Tommie Clancy was the boy who wasn&rsquo;t worrying
particularly. He saluted Peter as if he were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
going out on a holiday excursion. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she a
dog, Peter? Watch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she is&ndash;&ndash;and drive her, Tommie&ndash;&ndash;drive
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll drive her, Peter,&rdquo; called back Tommie,
and began:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I love old Ocean&rsquo;s smile,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>I love old Ocean&rsquo;s frowning&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>I love old Ocean all the while,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>My prayer&rsquo;s for death by drowning.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let you alone, Tommie, and you&rsquo;ll get your
prayer some day,&rdquo; was Peter&rsquo;s last hail as we
straightened out for the swoop across the line.</p>
<p>Clancy was to the wheel then with the skipper.
Both were lashed and we had life-lines around
deck. To the wheel of every vessel in the fleet
were two men lashed, and they all had life-lines
around deck.</p>
<p>In crossing the line there was no attempt at jockeying
such as one often sees in yacht racing. There
was no disposition on the part of any skipper to do
anything that would set anybody else back. Of
course, everybody wanted to be in a good berth and
to cross between the guns; but the idea was to give
the vessels such a try out as they would get out to
sea&ndash;&ndash;as if they were making a passage in a breeze.
The course&ndash;&ndash;forty-two miles or so&ndash;&ndash;was very short
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
for a fisherman, for one great thing in a fisherman
is her power to stand a long drag. Day and night
in and day and night out and driving all the time
is the way a fisherman wants it. Any sort of racing
machine could be built to stand a little hard
going for a while. But that wouldn&rsquo;t be living
through a long hard winter&rsquo;s gale on the Banks&ndash;&ndash;one
of those blows where wind and sea&ndash;&ndash;and in
shoal water at that&ndash;&ndash;have a chance to do their
worst. Fishermen are built for that sort of work
and on their sea-worthiness depends not only the
fortunes of owners but the lives of men&ndash;&ndash;of real
men&ndash;&ndash;and the happiness and comfort of wives and
children ashore. And so the idea in everybody&rsquo;s
mind that day was to make this test as nearly fair
as could be and see who had the fastest and most
weatherly boat in the fleet. There were men to
the wheel that day who could handle big fishermen
as if they were cat-boats, who would have
dared and did, later, dare to sail their vessels as
close to a mark in this sea as men sail a twenty-foot
knockabout in the smoothest of waters inshore&ndash;&ndash;only
with the fishermen a slip-up meant the loss of
a vessel, maybe other vessels too, and twenty-five
or fifty lives perhaps.</p>
<p>And so the skill of these men was not used to
give anybody the worst of it. A fair start and
give everybody his chance was the idea. Thus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
Tommie Ohlsen could have forced the Withrow
outside the starting boat and compelled her to come
about and maybe lose a few minutes, but he did
not. He held up and let her squeeze through.
O&rsquo;Donnell in his turn could have crowded Ohlsen
when he let up on the Withrow, but he did not.
He, too, held up in turn and let Ohlsen have his
swing going across.</p>
<p>Across we went, one after the other. West-sou&rsquo;west
was the course to a stake-boat, which we
were told would be found off Egg Rock, fourteen
miles away. We had only the compass to go by,
for at the start it was rain and drizzle, as well as
wind and a big sea, and you couldn&rsquo;t see a mile
ahead. On the way we shot by the New Rochelle,
which had started ahead with the intention of waiting
for the fleet at the first stake-boat. Now she
was headed back, wabbing awfully. From Billie
Simms, who went over part of the course in the
Henry Clay Parker ahead of the fleet, we got
word of the trouble as we went by. The New
Rochelle was beginning to leak. &ldquo;You c&rsquo;n spit
between her deck-planks and into her hold&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s
that loose,&rdquo; hollered Billie. I don&rsquo;t think the fishermen
aboard of her minded much so long as she
stayed afloat, but her captain, a properly licensed
man, did, I expect, and so she put back with some
of them growling, I heard afterward, &ldquo;and after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
paying their little old three dollars to see only the
start of the race.&rdquo; Her captain reported, when he
got in, that he didn&rsquo;t see anything outside but a
lot of foolish fishermen trying to drown themselves.</p>
<p>The first leg was before the wind and the Lucy
Foster and the Colleen Bawn went it like bullets.
I don&rsquo;t expect ever again to see vessels run faster
than they did that morning. On some of those
tough passages from the Banks fishing vessels may
at times have gone faster than either of these did
that morning. It is likely, for where a lot of able
vessels are all the time trying to make fast passages&ndash;&ndash;skippers
who are not afraid to carry sail
and vessels that can stand the dragging&ndash;&ndash;and in
all kinds of chances&ndash;&ndash;there must in the course of
years of trying be some hours when they do get
over an everlasting lot of water. But there are
no means of checking up. Half the time the men
do not haul the log for half a day or more. Some
of the reports of speed of fishermen at odd times
have been beyond all records, and so people who
do not know said they must be impossible. But
here was a measured course and properly anchored
stake-boats&ndash;&ndash;and the Lucy and the Colleen did that
first leg of almost fourteen sea-miles in fifty minutes,
which is better than a 16-1/2 knot clip, and
that means over nineteen land miles an hour. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
think anybody would call that pretty fast going.
And, as some of them said afterward, &ldquo;Lord in
Heaven! suppose we&rsquo;d had smooth water!&rdquo; But
I don&rsquo;t think that the sea checked them so very
much&ndash;&ndash;not as much as one might think, for they
were driving these vessels.</p>

<h3>O&rsquo;DONNELL CARRIES AWAY BOTH MASTS</h3>
</div>
<p>We were next to the last vessel across the
starting line. The Nannie O&ndash;&ndash;we
couldn&rsquo;t see them all&ndash;&ndash;about held the Lucy Foster
and the Colleen Bawn level. The Withrow
showed herself to be a wonderful vessel off the
wind, too. Wesley Marrs was around the stake-boat
first. In the fog and drizzle the leaders
did not find the stake-boat at once. Wesley happening
to be nearest to it when they did see it,
got the benefit and was first around. We were
close up, almost near enough to board the Withrow&rsquo;s
quarter rounding. I am not sure that the
skipper and Clancy, who were to the wheel, did
not try to give Hollis a poke with the end of our
long bowsprit; but if they did, the Johnnie was
not quite fast enough for that. The Withrow
beat us around. Looking back we could see the
others coming like wild horses. Every one of
them, except one that carried away something and
hauled up and out of it, was diving into it to the
foremast with every leap the same as we had been.
On that first leg nobody could stand anywhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
for&rsquo;ard of the fore-hatch or he would have been
swept overboard.</p>
<p>Leaving Egg Rock and going for Minot&rsquo;s
Ledge, the skipper left the wheel and George Nelson
took his place beside Clancy. It was drizzling
then, every now and then that settling down so
that we couldn&rsquo;t see three lengths ahead. At such
times we simply hoped that nobody ahead would
carry away anything or in any way become disabled
in the road.</p>
<p>Well clear of the stake-boat, however, it lifted
and we could see what we were doing. The Lucy
Foster was still ahead with O&rsquo;Donnell and Ohlsen
and Hollis almost abreast&ndash;&ndash;no more than a few
lengths between. Practically they were all about
just as they started. We were next. It was a
broad reach to Minot&rsquo;s Ledge and hard going for
all hands. It must be remembered that we all had
everything on, even to balloon and staysails, and
our halyards were lashed aloft. The men to the
mast-head, who were up there to shift tacks, were
having a sweet time of it hanging on, even lashed
though they were.</p>
<p>Everybody was pretty well strung up at this
time. The skipper, a line about his elbow, was
hooked up to the main-rigging&ndash;&ndash;the weather side,
of course&ndash;&ndash;and it was up to a man&rsquo;s waist and
boiling white on the lee side. The crew were snug
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
up under the weather rail and hanging on&ndash;&ndash;no
mistake either about the way they were hanging
on. Every once in awhile one of us would poke
his head up to see what they were doing to
windward of us. Mr. Duncan, who had come
aboard just before we left the dock, was trying to
sit on the weather bitt near the wheel-box. He
had a line around his waist, too. He had bet a
lot of money with Withrow on the race, but I don&rsquo;t
think that his money was worrying him half so
much as some other things then.</p>
<p>So far as we could see at this time we were
making as good weather as any of them. And our
best chance&ndash;&ndash;the beat home&ndash;&ndash;was yet to come.
The Johnnie had the stiffness for that. Had the
Johnnie reached Gloucester from the Cape Shore
earlier she, too, would have been lightened up and
made less stiff. To be sure she would have had
her bottom scrubbed and we would have had her
up to racing pitch, with every bit of sail just so and
her trim gauged to a hair&rsquo;s depth, but that did not
matter so very much now. The Johnnie was in
shape for a hard drag like this, and for that we
had to thank the tricky Sam Hollis. We began to
see that after all it was a bit of good luck our
vessel not being home in time to tune up the same
as the rest of the fleet.</p>
<p>It was along about here&ndash;&ndash;half-way on the reach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
to Minot&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;that Tommie Ohlsen broke his main-gaff.
It was the fault of the Eastern Point, the
Boston steamer. She had gone ahead of the fleet,
taking almost a straight course for Minot&rsquo;s Ledge.
Reaching across from Half-Way Rock to Minot&rsquo;s
the fleet began to overhaul her. She, making bad
weather of it along here, started to turn around.
But, rolling to her top-rail, it was too much for
them, and her captain kept her straight on for Boston.
That was all right, but her action threw Ohlsen
off. She was right in the Nannie O&rsquo;s way, and
to save the steamer and themselves from a collision
and certain loss of life, Ohlsen had to jibe the
Nannie O, and so suddenly that the Nannie O&rsquo;s
gaff broke under the strain. And that lost Ohlsen
his chance for the race. It was too bad, for with
Ohlsen, Marrs, and O&rsquo;Donnell, each in his own
vessel in a breeze, you could put the names in a
hat and shake them up. When we went by the
Nannie O her crew were getting the trysail out
of the hold, and they finished the race with that,
and made good going of it, as we saw afterward.
Indeed, a trysail that day would have been sail
enough for almost any men but these.</p>
<p>Before we reached Minot&rsquo;s there was some sail
went into the air. One after the other went the
balloons&ndash;&ndash;on the Foster, the Colleen, the
Withrow and at last on us. I don&rsquo;t know whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
they had any trouble on the others&ndash;&ndash;being too busy
with our own to watch&ndash;&ndash;but we came near to losing
men with ours. It got caught under our keel,
and we started to try to haul it in&ndash;&ndash;the skipper
having an economical notion of saving the owner
the expense of a new sail, I suppose. But Mr.
Duncan, seeing what he was at, sang out: &ldquo;Let the
sail go to the devil, Captain&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll pay for the new
one myself.&rdquo; Even at that we had to crawl out on
the bowsprit&ndash;&ndash;six or eight of us&ndash;&ndash;with sharp
knives, and cut it away, and we were glad to get
back again. The Johnnie never slackened. It
was desperate work.</p>
<p>Rounding Minot&rsquo;s, Tom O&rsquo;Donnell gave an exhibition
of desperate seamanship. He had made
up his mind, it seems, that he was due to pass
Wesley Marrs along here. But first he had to get
by the Withrow. Off Minot&rsquo;s was the turning
buoy, with just room, as it was considered, for one
vessel at a time to pass safely in that sea.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Donnell figured that the tide being high there
was easily room for two, and then breasted up to
the Withrow, outside of her and with the rocks
just under his quarter. Hollis, seeing him come,
made a motion as if to force him on the rocks, but
O&rsquo;Donnell, standing to his own wheel, called out&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;You
do, Sam Hollis, and we&rsquo;ll both go.&rdquo; There
certainly would have been a collision, with both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
vessels and both crews&ndash;&ndash;fifty men&ndash;&ndash;very likely lost,
but Hollis weakened and kept off. That kind of
work was too strong for him. He had so little
room that his main-boom hit the can-buoy as he
swept by.</p>
<p>Once well around O&rsquo;Donnell, in great humor,
and courting death, worked by Hollis and then,
making ready to tack and pass Wesley&rsquo;s bow, let
the Colleen have her swing, but with all that sail on
and in that breeze, there could be only one outcome.
And yet he might have got away with it
but for his new foremast, which, as he had feared,
had not the strength it should have had. He let
her go, never stopped to haul in his sheets&ndash;&ndash;he had
not time to if he was to cross Wesley&rsquo;s bow. So he
swung her and the full force of the wind getting
her laid both spars over the side&ndash;&ndash;first one and
then the other clean as could be.</p>
<p>Hollis never stopped or made a motion to help,
but kept on after the Lucy Foster. We almost ran
over O&rsquo;Donnell, but luffed in time, and the skipper
called out to O&rsquo;Donnell that we&rsquo;d stand by and
take his men off.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Donnell was swearing everything blue. &ldquo;Go
on&ndash;&ndash;go on&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t mind me. Go on, I tell you.
We&rsquo;re all right. I&rsquo;ll have her under jury rig and
be home for supper. Go on, Maurice&ndash;&ndash;go on and
beat that divil Hollis!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>Half way to Eastern Point on the way back
saw us in the wake of the Withrow, which was
then almost up with the Lucy Foster. It was the
beat home now, with all of us looking to see the
Withrow do great things, for just off the ways
and with all her ballast in she was in great trim
for it. Going to windward, too, was generally
held to be her best point of sailing. All that Hollis
had to do was to keep his nerve and drive her.</p>

<h2>XXXIII</h2>
<h3>THE ABLE JOHNNIE DUNCAN</h3>
</div>
<p>Hollis was certainly driving her now. He
ought to have felt safe in doing so with
the Lucy Foster to go by, for the Lucy, by reason
of the ballast taken out of her, should, everything
else being equal, capsize before the Withrow.</p>
<p>Hollis must have had that in mind, for he followed
Wesley Marrs&rsquo;s every move. Wesley was
sailing her wide. And our skipper approved of
that, too. To attempt a too close course in the
sea that was out in the Bay that day, with the
blasts of wind that were sweeping down, would
have deadened her way altogether too much&ndash;&ndash;maybe
hung her up. And so it was &ldquo;Keep her a
full whatever you do,&rdquo; and that, with coming
about when the others did&ndash;&ndash;we being afraid to
split tacks&ndash;&ndash;made plenty of work for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard-a-lee&rdquo; it was one after the other, and for
every &ldquo;Hard-a-lee&rdquo; twenty of us went down into
the roaring sea fore and aft and hauled in and
slackened away sheets, while aloft, the fellows
lashed to the foremast head shifted top and staysail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
tacks. They were wise to lash themselves
up aloft, for with every tack, she rolled down into
it as if she were never coming up, and when she
did come up shook herself as if she would snap
her topmasts off.</p>
<p>Half way to Eastern Point on the beat home it
seemed to occur to the skipper and to Clancy that
the Johnnie Duncan stood a chance to win the race.
It was Clancy, still lashed to the wheel, now with
Long Steve, turned his head for just a second to
Mr. Duncan and spoke the first word of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Duncan, do you know, but the Johnnie&rsquo;s
got a chance to win this race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;y&rsquo;think so, Tommie&ndash;&ndash;d&rsquo;y&rsquo;think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of us in the crew had been thinking of
that same thing some time, and we watched Mr.
Duncan, who, with a life line about him, was
clinging to a bitt aft, and watching things with
tight lips, a drawn face and shiny eyes. We listened
to hear what else he might have to say. But
he didn&rsquo;t realize at once what it meant. His eyes
and his mind were on the Lucy Foster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;y&rsquo;think of the Lucy and the Withrow,
Tommie?&rdquo; Mr. Duncan said next.</p>
<p>Tommie took a fresh look at the Lucy Foster,
which was certainly doing stunts. It was along
this time that big Jim Murch&ndash;&ndash;a tall man, but
even so, he was no more than six feet four, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
the Lucy twenty-four feet beam&ndash;&ndash;was swinging
from the ring-bolts under the windward rail and
throwing his feet out trying to touch with his heels
the sea that was swashing up on the Lucy&rsquo;s deck.
And every once in a while he did touch, for the
Lucy, feeling the need of her ballast, was making
pretty heavy weather of it. Every time she rolled
and her sheer poles went under, Jim would holler
out that he&rsquo;d touched again.</p>
<p>We could hear him over on the Johnnie at times.
Mr. Duncan, who believed that nothing ever built
could beat the Lucy Foster, began to worry at
that, and again he spoke to Clancy. He had to
holler to make himself heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you think of the Lucy&rsquo;s chances,
Tommie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy shook his head.</p>
<p>And getting nothing out of Clancy, Mr. Duncan
called out then: &ldquo;What do you think of the Lucy,
you, Captain Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper shook his head, too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
it&rsquo;s too much for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then&ndash;&ndash;one elbow was hitched in the weather
rigging and a half hitch around his waist&ndash;&ndash;the
skipper swung around, and looking over to the
Withrow, he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, Mr. Duncan, why we don&rsquo;t stand
a pretty good chance to win out on Hollis.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not&ndash;&ndash;why not&ndash;&ndash;if anything happens to
the Lucy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It jarred us some to think that even there, in
spite of the great race the Johnnie was making of
it, she was still, in the old man&rsquo;s eyes, only a second
string to the Lucy Foster.</p>
<p>About then the wind seemed to come harder
than ever, but Clancy at the wheel never let up
on the Johnnie. He socked it to her&ndash;&ndash;wide and
free he sailed her. Kept her going&ndash;&ndash;oh, but he
kept her going. &ldquo;If this one only had a clean
bottom and a chance to tune her up before going
out,&rdquo; said somebody, and we all said, &ldquo;Oh, if she
only had&ndash;&ndash;just half a day on the railway before
this race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were fairly buried at times on the Johnnie&ndash;&ndash;on
the Lucy Foster it must have been tough.
And along here the staysail came off the Withrow
and eased her a lot. We would all have been better
off with less sail along about that time. In
proof of that we could see back behind us where
the Nannie O, under her trysail, was almost holding
her own. But it wouldn&rsquo;t do to take it off.
Had they not all said before putting off that morning
that what sail came off that day would be
blown off?&ndash;&ndash;yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;let it blow a hundred miles
an hour. And fishermen&rsquo;s pride was keeping sail
on us and the Foster. Hollis tried to make it look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
that his staysail blew off, but we knew better&ndash;&ndash;a
knife to the halyards did the work.</p>
<p>It was after her big staysail was off and she making
easier weather of it that the Withrow crossed
the Lucy&rsquo;s bow for the first time in the race and
took the lead.</p>
<p>We all felt for Mr. Duncan, who couldn&rsquo;t seem
to believe his eyes. We all felt for Wesley, too,
who was desperately trying to hold the wind of the
Withrow&ndash;&ndash;he had even rigged blocks to his jib
sheets and led them to cleats clear aft to flatten his
headsails yet more. And Wesley&rsquo;s crew hauled
like demons on those jib sheets&ndash;&ndash;hauled and hauled
with the vessel under way all the time&ndash;&ndash;hauled so
hard, in fact, that with the extra purchase given
them by the blocks they pulled the cleats clean out,
and away went the Lucy&rsquo;s jib and jumbo&ndash;&ndash;and
there was Wesley hung up. And out of the race,
for we were all too near the finish for her to win
out then unless the Johnnie and the Withrow capsized
entirely.</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan, when he saw the Lucy&rsquo;s crew
trying to save the headsails, couldn&rsquo;t contain
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut &rsquo;em away&ndash;&ndash;cut &rsquo;em to hell!&rdquo; he sang out,
and we all had to smile, he spoke so excitedly. But
it was no use. The Lucy was out of the race, and
going by her, we didn&rsquo;t look at Mr. Duncan nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
Wesley Marrs&ndash;&ndash;we knew they were both taking
it hard&ndash;&ndash;but watched the Withrow.</p>
<p>Over on the other tack we went, first the
Withrow, then the Johnnie. We were nearing the
finish line, and we were pretty well worked up&ndash;&ndash;the
awful squalls were swooping down and burying
us. We could hear Hollis&rsquo;s voice and see his crew
go up when he warned his men at the wheel to
ease up on her when the squalls hit. On our vessel
the skipper never waved an arm nor opened his
mouth to Clancy at the wheel. And of his own
accord you may be sure that Clancy wasn&rsquo;t easing
up. Not Tommie Clancy&ndash;&ndash;no, sir&ndash;&ndash;he just drove
her&ndash;&ndash;let her have it full&ndash;&ndash;lashed her like, with his
teeth and eyes flashing through the sea that was
swashing over him. And the Johnnie fairly
sizzled through the water.</p>
<p>There were several times in the race when we
thought the going was as bad as could be, but now
we were all sure that this was the worst of all.
There was some excuse for Mr. Duncan when he
called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, Tommie, but if she makes one of
those low dives again, will she ever come up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Clancy to that. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you
worry, Mr. Duncan, if any vessel out of Gloucester&rsquo;ll
come up, this one&rsquo;ll come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was standing with the water, the clear water,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
not the swash, well up to his waist then, and we
could hear him:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I love old Ocean&rsquo;s smile,</p>
<p><span class='indent3'>&nbsp;</span>I love old Ocean&rsquo;s frowning&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>I love old Ocean all the while,</p>
<p><span class='indent3'>&nbsp;</span>My prayer&rsquo;s for death by drowning.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>That was too much for Mr. Duncan, and,
watching his chance, he dove between the house
and rail, to the weather rigging, where the skipper
grabbed him and made him fast beside himself.
The old man took a look down the slant of the
deck and took a fresh hold of the rigging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Blake, isn&rsquo;t she down pretty low?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe&ndash;&ndash;maybe&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Duncan, but she&rsquo;ll go
lower yet before the sail comes off her. This is
the day Sam Hollis was going to make me take in
sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Less than a minute after that we made our rush
for the line. Hollis tried to crowd us outside the
stake-boat, which was rolling head to wind and
sea, worse than a lightship in a surf gale&ndash;&ndash;tried to
crowd us out just as an awful squall swooped down.
It was the Johnnie or the Withrow then. We took
it full and they didn&rsquo;t, and there is all there was
to it. But for a minute it was either vessel&rsquo;s race.
At the critical time Sam Hollis didn&rsquo;t have the
nerve, and the skipper and Clancy did.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>They looked at each other&ndash;&ndash;the skipper and
Clancy&ndash;&ndash;and Clancy soaked her. Held to it
cruelly&ndash;&ndash;recklessly. It was too much to ask of a
vessel. Down she went&ndash;&ndash;buried. It was heaven
or hell, as they say, for a while. I know I climbed
on to her weather run, and it was from there I
saw Withrow ducking her head to it&ndash;&ndash;hove to,
in fact, for the blast to pass.</p>
<p>The Johnnie weathered it. Able&ndash;&ndash;able. Up
she rose, a horse, and across the line we shot like
a bullet, and so close to the judge&rsquo;s boat that we
could have jumped aboard.</p>
<p>We all but hit the Henry Clay Parker, Billie
Simms&rsquo;s vessel, on the other side of the line, and
it was on her that old Peter of Crow&rsquo;s Nest, leaping
into the air and cracking his heels together,
called out as we drove by:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Johnnie Duncan wins&ndash;&ndash;the able Johnnie
Duncan&ndash;&ndash;sailin&rsquo; across the line on her side and
her crew sittin&rsquo; out on the keel.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XXXIV</h2>
<h3>MINNIE ARKELL ONCE MORE</h3>
</div>
<p>We were hardly across the line when there
was a broom at our truck&ndash;&ndash;a new broom
that I know I, for one, never saw before. And yet
I suppose every vessel that sailed in the race that
day had a new broom hid away somewhere below&ndash;&ndash;to
be handy if needed.</p>
<p>But it was the Johnnie Duncan, sailing up the
harbor, that carried hers to the truck. And it was
Mr. Duncan who stood aft of her and took most
of the cheers, and it was Clancy and Long Steve
who waved their hands from the wheel-box, and
it was the skipper who leaned against the weather
rigging, and the rest of us who lined the weather
rail and answered the foolish questions of people
along the road.</p>
<p>Every vessel we met seemed to think we had
done something great; and I suppose we had in a
way&ndash;&ndash;that is, skipper, crew and vessel. We had
out-carried and out-sailed the best out of Gloucester
in a breeze that was a breeze. We had taken
the chance of being capsized or hove-down and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
losing the vessel and ourselves. Mr. Duncan, I
think, realized more than anybody else at the time
what we had been through. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what
it really was to be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before I started. If
I had, I doubt very much if I&rsquo;d have started.&rdquo; We
all said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;No, no, you&rsquo;d have gone just the same,
Mr. Duncan;&rdquo; and we believed he would, too.</p>
<p>Going up the harbor somebody hinted to Clancy
that he ought to go and have a mug-up for himself
after his hard work&ndash;&ndash;and it had been hard work.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take your place at the wheel,&rdquo; said that
somebody, &ldquo;for you must be tired, Tommie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe I am tired, too,&rdquo; answered Clancy,
&ldquo;but if I am, I&rsquo;m just thick enough not to know
it. But don&rsquo;t fool yourself that if I stood lashed
to this wheel since she crossed the starting line this
morning I&rsquo;m going to quit it now and let you take
her up the harbor and get all the bouquets. I&rsquo;ll
have a mug-up by and by, and it&rsquo;ll be a mug-up,
don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was a mug-up. He took the gold and
silver cup given to Maurice as a skipper of the
winning vessel, and with the crew in his wake
headed a course for the Anchorage, where he filled
it till it flowed&ndash;&ndash;and didn&rsquo;t have to pay for filling
it, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the swellest growler that I ever expect to
empty. Gold and silver&ndash;&ndash;and holds six quarts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
level. Just a little touch all round, and we&rsquo;ll fill
her up again. &lsquo;Carte blanche, and charge it to
me,&rsquo; says Mr. Duncan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind is carte blanche, Tommie?&rdquo; asked
Andie Howe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll tell you behind the bar,&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billie,&rdquo; ordered Andie, &ldquo;just a little touch of
carte blanche, will you, while Clancy&rsquo;s talking.
He&rsquo;s the slowest man to begin that ever I see.
Speeches&ndash;&ndash;speeches&ndash;&ndash;speeches, when your throat&rsquo;s
full of gurry&ndash;&ndash;dry, salty gurry. A little touch of
that carte blanche that Mr. Duncan ordered for
the crew of the Johnnie Duncan, Billie, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carte blanche&ndash;&ndash;yes,&rdquo; went on Clancy, &ldquo;and I
callate the old fizzy stuff&rsquo;s the thing to do justice
to this fe-lic-i-tous oc-ca-sion. Do I hear the voice
of my shipmates? Aye, aye, I hear them&ndash;&ndash;and in
accents unmistakable. Well, here&rsquo;s a shoot&ndash;&ndash;six
quarts level&ndash;&ndash;and a few pieces of ice floating
around on top. My soul, but don&rsquo;t it look fine and
rich? Have a look, everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a drink instead,&rdquo; hollered Parsons.</p>
<p>Clancy paid no attention to that. &ldquo;Who was
the lad in that Greek bunch in the old days that
they sank up to his neck in the lake&ndash;&ndash;cold sparkling
water&ndash;&ndash;and peaches and oranges and grapes
floating on a little raft close by&ndash;&ndash;but him fixed so
he couldn&rsquo;t bend his head down to get a drink nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
lift his head to take a bite of fruit&ndash;&ndash;and hot
weather all the time, mind you. Lord, the thirst
he raised after a while! What was his&ndash;&ndash;oh, yes,
Tantalus&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s the lad, Tantalus&ndash;&ndash;the cold
sparkling water. Man, the thirst he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thirst of Tantalus ain&rsquo;t a patch on the
thirst I got. And this is something better than
cold sparkling water. That&rsquo;s you all over, Tommie&ndash;&ndash;joking
at serious times,&rdquo; wailed Parsons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it as bad as that with you, Eddie? Well,
let&rsquo;s forget Tantalus and drink instead to the
able-est, handsom-est, fast-est vessel that ever
weathered Eastern Point&ndash;&ndash;to the Johnnie Duncan&ndash;&ndash;and
her skipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Duncan, Tommie&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s all right,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, Mr. Duncan. And while we&rsquo;re
at it, here&rsquo;s to the whole blessed gang of us&ndash;&ndash;skipper,
owner and crew&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;re all corkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive her, Tommie!&rdquo; roared a dozen voices,
and Tommie drove her for a good pint before he
set the cup down again.</p>
<p>It was a great celebration altogether. Wherever
one of our gang was there was an admiring
crowd. Nobody but us was listened to. And the
questions we had to answer! And of course we
were all willing enough to talk. We must have
told the story of the race over about twenty times
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
each. After a while, of course, some of our fellows,
with all the entertaining and admiration that
was handed out to them, had to put a touch or two
to it. It was strong enough to tell the bare facts
of that race, I thought, but one or two had to give
their imaginations a chance. One man, a fisherman,
one of those who had been on one of the excursion
boats, and so didn&rsquo;t see the race at all,
came along about two hours after the Duncan
crew struck the Anchorage and listened to Andie
Howe for a while. And going away it was he who
said, &ldquo;It must have been a race that. As near as
I c&rsquo;n make it out the Johnnie sailed most of that
race keel up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go away mad,&rdquo; Andie called after
him. &ldquo;Come back and have a little touch of carte
blanche&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s on the old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it for him,&rdquo; came a voice. It was old
Peter of Crow&rsquo;s Nest, who took his drink and
asked for Clancy. Clancy was in the back part of
the room, and I ran and got him. Peter led the
way to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommie, go and get Maurice, if it ain&rsquo;t too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Minnie Arkell. Coming up the dock after
the race she ran up and grabbed him and threw her
arms about his neck. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the man to sail a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
race in heavy weather,&rsquo; she hollers, and a hundred
people looking on. And there&rsquo;s half a dozen of
those friends of hers and they&rsquo;re up to her house
and now making ready for a wine celebration. Go
and get him before it is too late.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XXXV</h2>
<h3>CLANCY LAYS DOWN THE LAW</h3>
</div>
<p>Clancy started on the run and I after him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to his boarding-house first, Joe,
and if he&rsquo;s not there, to Minnie Arkell&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t in his boarding-house, and we hurried
out. On the sidewalk we almost ran into
little Johnnie Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Clancy&ndash;&ndash;or you, Joe Buckley&ndash;&ndash;won&rsquo;t
you tell me about the race? Grandpa was
too busy to tell me, but went down the wharf with
a lot of people to show them the Johnnie Duncan.
They all left the office and told me to mind it.
And my cousin Alice came in with Joe&rsquo;s cousin
Nell. And I saw Captain Blake with some people
and ran after him and I just caught up with him
and they went off and left me. And then a little
while ago he came back by himself and ran toward
the dock and didn&rsquo;t even see me. And Captain
Blake used to be so good to me!&rdquo; Poor Johnnie
was all but crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward the dock? That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; breathed
Clancy. &ldquo;Stay here, Johnnie, and we&rsquo;ll tell you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
about the race when we get back,&rdquo; and led the
way to Mr. Duncan&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>We found the skipper in the outer office, standing
beside the bookkeeper&rsquo;s desk and looking out
of the window next the slip. Hearing us coming
he turned and then we saw that he held in his
hands an open box with a string of beautiful pearls.
Noticing us gaze at the pearls in surprise, he said,
&ldquo;Mr. Duncan gave me these for winning the race.
And I took them, thinking that somebody or other
might like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; asked Clancy&ndash;&ndash;it seemed to
slip out of Tommie without his knowing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; said Maurice. Only then did it
flash on me what it all might mean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you try?&rdquo; asked Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try! Yes, and was made a fool of. Oh,
what&rsquo;s the use&ndash;&ndash;what in hell&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; He stood
silent a moment. &ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; he said then&ndash;&ndash;looked
out the window again, and hove the whole
string out of the open window and into the slip.</p>
<p>Clancy and myself both jumped to stop him, but
we weren&rsquo;t quick enough. They were gone&ndash;&ndash;the
whole beautiful necklace. The skipper fixed his
eyes on where they had struck the water. Then
he turned and left the office. At the door he
stopped and said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;maybe I won&rsquo;t
take the Johnnie next trip, and if I don&rsquo;t, Tommie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
I hope you&rsquo;ll take her&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Duncan will let you
have her if you want. I hope you&rsquo;ll take her anyway,
for you know what a vessel she is. You&rsquo;ll
take care of her&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and went and left us.</p>
<p>Clancy swore to himself for a while. He hadn&rsquo;t
quite done when the door of the rear office opened
and Miss Foster herself came out. She greeted
me sweetly&ndash;&ndash;she always did&ndash;&ndash;but was going out
without paying any attention to Clancy. She
looked pale&ndash;&ndash;although perhaps I would not have
noticed her paleness particularly only for what had
just happened.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see then what Clancy did.
Before she had got to the door he was beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Foster, Miss Foster,&rdquo; he said, and his
tone was so different from what I had ever heard
from him before that I could hardly believe it. He
was a big man, it must be remembered, and still
on him were the double-banked oilskins and heavy
jack-boots he wore through the race. Also his
face was flushed from the excitement of the day&ndash;&ndash;the
salt water was not yet dry on him and his
eyes were shining, shining not alone with the glow
of a man who had been lashed to a wheel steering
a vessel in a gale&ndash;&ndash;and, too, to victory&ndash;&ndash;for hours,
and not alone with the light that comes from two
or three quarts of champagne&ndash;&ndash;it was something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
more than that. Whatever it was it surprised me
and held Alice Foster&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister Clancy,&rdquo; she said, and turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mister Clancy&ndash;&ndash;or Tommie Clancy&ndash;&ndash;or
Captain Clancy, as it is at times&ndash;&ndash;master of an odd
vessel now and again&ndash;&ndash;but Clancy all the time&ndash;&ndash;just
Clancy, good-for-nothing Clancy&ndash;&ndash;hard drinker&ndash;&ndash;reveller&ndash;&ndash;night-owl&ndash;&ndash;disturber
of the peace&ndash;&ndash;at
best only a fisherman who&rsquo;ll by and by go out
and get lost like thousands of the other fishermen
before him&ndash;&ndash;as a hundred every year do now and
have three lines in the paper&ndash;&ndash;name, age, birthplace,
street and number of his boarding-house,
and that will be the end of it. But that don&rsquo;t
matter&ndash;&ndash;Tommie Clancy, whatever he is, is a
friend of Maurice Blake&rsquo;s. And he means to
speak a word for Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time now, Miss Foster, Maurice has
thought the world of you. He never told me&ndash;&ndash;he
never told anybody. But I know him. He waited
a long time, I&rsquo;m sure, before he even told himself&ndash;&ndash;maybe
even before he knew it himself. But I
knew it&ndash;&ndash;bunk-mates, watch-mates, dory-mates
we&rsquo;ve been. He&rsquo;s master of a fine vessel now and
I&rsquo;m one of his crew. He&rsquo;s gone ahead and I&rsquo;ve
stayed behind. Why? Because he&rsquo;s carried in his
heart the picture of a girl he thought could be all a
woman ought to be to a man. And that was well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
A man like Maurice needs that, and maybe&ndash;&ndash;maybe&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re
all that he thought and more maybe, Miss
Foster. Wait&ndash;&ndash;he had that picture before his eyes
all the time. I hadn&rsquo;t any picture. Years ago,
when I was Maurice&rsquo;s age, I might have had something
like it, and now look at me. And why?
Why, Miss Foster, you&rsquo;re a woman&ndash;&ndash;could you
guess? No? Think. What&rsquo;s running in a man&rsquo;s
head, do you think, in the long winter nights when
he&rsquo;s walking the deck, with the high heavens above
and the great, black rolling sea around him?
What&rsquo;s in his head when, trawls hauled and his
fish aboard, when the danger and the hard work
are mostly by, his vessel&rsquo;s going to the west&rsquo;ard?
What when he&rsquo;s an hour to rest and he&rsquo;s lying,
smoking and thinking, in his bunk? What&rsquo;s been
in Maurice&rsquo;s head and in his heart all the years he&rsquo;s
loafed with the likes of me and yet never fell to
my level? Anything he ever read anywhere, do
you think, or was it a warm image that every time
he came ashore and was lucky enough to get a
look at you he could see was true to the woman
it stood for? When you had no more idea of it
than what was going on at the North Pole he was
watching you&ndash;&ndash;and thinking of you. Always
thinking of you, Miss Foster. He never thought
he had a chance. I know him. Who asks a
woman like you to share a fisherman&rsquo;s life? Is it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
a man like Maurice? Sometimes&ndash;&ndash;maybe with
the blood racing through him after a great race he
might. A while ago he did, Miss Foster. And
what gave him the courage?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me now, Miss Foster, and say what
you please afterward. Maurice and I are friends.
Friends. I&rsquo;ve been with him on the bottom of a
capsized dory when we both expected we&rsquo;d hauled
our last trawl&ndash;&ndash;with the seas washing over us and
we both getting weak and him getting black in
the face&ndash;&ndash;and maybe I was, too. I told you this
once before, but let me tell it again. &lsquo;Come and
take the plug strap, Tommie,&rsquo; he says to me.
&lsquo;Come and take the plug strap.&rsquo; Do you know
what that means, Miss Foster?&ndash;&ndash;and the seas
sweeping over you and your whole body getting
numb? And I&rsquo;ve been with him four days and
four nights&ndash;&ndash;astray in the fog of the Western
Banks in winter, and, for all we knew and believed,
we were gone. In times like those men get
to know each other, and I tell you, Miss Foster&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
Clancy choked and stopped. &ldquo;To-day
he sailed a race the like of which was never sailed
before. A dozen times he took the chance of himself
going over the rail. And why? The better
to keep an eye on things and help his vessel along?
Yes. But why that? For that cup we&rsquo;ve drowned
a dozen times in wine to-day? He never looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
twice at it when he got ashore. He hasn&rsquo;t seen it
since he handed it to me on the dock. The boys
might like to look at it, he said. He&rsquo;s forgot he
ever won it by now. He let us take it up to a
rum-shop and drink out of it the same as if it was
a tin-pail&ndash;&ndash;the beautiful gold and silver cup&ndash;&ndash;engraved.
We used it for a growler for all Maurice
cared for the value of it, and there&rsquo;s forty men
walking the streets now that&rsquo;s got a list they got
out of that cup. We might have lost it, battered
each other&rsquo;s drunken heads in with it, and he
wouldn&rsquo;t have said a dozen words about it. But
there was a necklace of pearls, and he thought you&rsquo;d
like them. &lsquo;To you, Maurice, for winning the
race,&rsquo; says Mr. Duncan, &lsquo;for winning the race,&rsquo;
and hands Maurice the pearls&ndash;&ndash;your own guardian,
Miss Foster, and most crazy, he was that
pleased. And that&rsquo;s what Maurice ran up to get
when the race was over&ndash;&ndash;there was something a
girl might like, or thought so. And then what?
On the way down a woman that I know&ndash;&ndash;that you
know&ndash;&ndash;tried to hold him up. Kissed him before a
hundred people&ndash;&ndash;she knew you were waiting&ndash;&ndash;she
knew, trust a woman&ndash;&ndash;and walked down part way
with him, because you were looking. And he being
a man, and weak, and only twenty-six&ndash;&ndash;and the
racing blood still running through him&ndash;&ndash;maybe
forgot himself for five minutes&ndash;&ndash;not knowing you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
were within a mile. That doesn&rsquo;t excuse him? No,
you&rsquo;re right, it don&rsquo;t. But he, poor boy, knowing
nothing&ndash;&ndash;what does a boy of twenty-six know?&ndash;&ndash;knowing
nothing&ndash;&ndash;suspecting nothing&ndash;&ndash;and yet, if
he forgot himself, he never really forgot you. He
hurries on to you and offers you the necklace that
he risked his life to get. And you&ndash;&ndash;what did you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I say? I told him that perhaps he
knew somebody that he&rsquo;d rather give it to before
me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you? There&rsquo;s a woman. You&rsquo;re not
satisfied when a man fights all the devil in himself
for you, but you must rub it into him while
he&rsquo;s doing it. Maurice&ndash;&ndash;or maybe you don&rsquo;t understand.
You could say things like that to a dog&ndash;&ndash;if
a dog could understand&ndash;&ndash;and he&rsquo;d come back
and lick your hand. Maurice has blood and fire in
him. And here&rsquo;s a woman&ndash;&ndash;whatever else she is&ndash;&ndash;is
warm-blooded too. She wants Maurice, and,
by God, she&rsquo;ll get him if you keep on. Do you remember
the night of the Master Mariners&rsquo; ball&ndash;&ndash;the
night before we sailed on the Southern cruise?
Well, that night this woman, she waits for Maurice
and stops him on his way home. But she didn&rsquo;t
get him. He was up in the wind for a minute or
two, but one spoke of the wheel and he found his
head again. Again last June in Newport on a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
warm summer&rsquo;s night&ndash;&ndash;flowers, music, wine&ndash;&ndash;the
cabin of a beautiful yacht&ndash;&ndash;she asks him to wait
over a day or two in Newport harbor. Does he?
Does he? Not Maurice. With never a touch of
the wheel, off he swings and drives for home. And
why didn&rsquo;t he stay? Why, do you suppose?
Didn&rsquo;t he tell you a while ago? Good God! Look
here&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re no fool. Look at me&ndash;&ndash;ten years ago
I was another Maurice. And this woman&ndash;&ndash;I tell
you she knows men. She don&rsquo;t care whether a
man is rich or poor, tall or short, thin or fat, so
long as she likes him. And I tell you she loves
Maurice&ndash;&ndash;as well as she can love&ndash;&ndash;and she&rsquo;s not
a good enough woman&ndash;&ndash;there it is. And they&rsquo;re
all saying you&rsquo;re likely to marry Withrow. Wait
now. Withrow, I&rsquo;m telling you, isn&rsquo;t fit to wash
the gurry off Maurice&rsquo;s jack-boots. I&rsquo;m a careless
man, Miss Foster, and in my life I&rsquo;ve done things
I wish now I hadn&rsquo;t, but I draw the line above the
head of a man like Withrow. Whatever I am,
I&rsquo;m too good to be company for Fred Withrow.
And on top of all that he&rsquo;s so carried away with
this other woman&ndash;&ndash;this same woman&ndash;&ndash;and she
caring more for Maurice&rsquo;s eyelash than Withrow&rsquo;s
whole two hundred and ten pounds&ndash;&ndash;Withrow is
so carried away with her that he is ready to elope
with her&ndash;&ndash;elope with her! I know that&ndash;&ndash;never
mind how. Bring Withrow and me together, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
I&rsquo;ll tell him&ndash;&ndash;tell him, yes, and throw him through
the door afterward if he denies it. This woman
is enough of a woman to want Maurice&ndash;&ndash;Maurice
with nothing at all&ndash;&ndash;before Withrow with all he&rsquo;s
got and all he can get her or give her&ndash;&ndash;and she&rsquo;s
clever enough to come pretty near getting what
she wants. And now, Miss Foster, suppose you
think it over. I&rsquo;m going to hunt up Maurice,
though I&rsquo;m not too sure we&rsquo;ll find him in a hurry.
Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swept his sou&rsquo;wester wide to her and went
out the door. I said good-by without looking at
her. I was too ashamed&ndash;&ndash;and went after Clancy.
But I think she was crying to herself as I went
out.</p>

<h2>XXXVI</h2>
<h3>MAURICE BLAKE IS RECALLED</h3>
</div>
<p>The morning after the race I was eating
breakfast at home and I could not remember
when I enjoyed a meal like that one. I
had had a fine long sleep and the sleep that comes
to a man after he&rsquo;s been through a long and exciting
experience does make him feel like a world-beater.
I felt that I could go out and about leap
the length of a seine-boat or rip up a plank sidewalk.
It was worth while to be alive, and everything
tasted so good.</p>
<p>I had put away six fried eggs and about fourteen
of those little slices of bacon before I even
thought of slacking up (with my mother piling
them up as fast as I lifted them off)&ndash;&ndash;and maybe
I wouldn&rsquo;t have slacked then only my cousin Nell
came skipping in.</p>
<p>She kissed my mother half a dozen times, and
danced around the room. &ldquo;Four vessels off the
Johnnie Duncan&rsquo;s model have already been ordered.
Four, auntie&ndash;&ndash;four. There will be a fleet
of them yet, you&rsquo;ll see. And how are you, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; I said, and kept on eating.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>Nell didn&rsquo;t like my not noticing how glad she
was feeling, I suppose, for all at once, as I was
about to sugar another cup of coffee, she ran her
hands through my hair and yanked till I couldn&rsquo;t
pretend any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, with your mind off your stomach,
perhaps you&rsquo;ll look up and converse when a lady
deigns to notice you. How much money did Mr.
Withrow lose on the race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it was a good pile; I know
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much did Mr. Duncan win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, either; but I hope it was a
good roll, for he won about all Withrow lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-m&ndash;&ndash;but aren&rsquo;t you in love with your old
employer? But let&rsquo;s not mind common money
matters. What do you think of the Johnnie Duncan
for a vessel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dog&ndash;&ndash;a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she! And the fastest, able-est and the
handsomest vessel that ever sailed past Eastern
Point, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who designed her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Let me see. Oh, yes, some local man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know! Look up here. Who designed
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. &rsquo;Twas a Gloucester man.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A Gloucester man? Look up again. Now&ndash;&ndash;who&ndash;&ndash;de&ndash;&ndash;signed&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;John&ndash;&ndash;nie&ndash;&ndash;Dun&ndash;&ndash;can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch, yes. A ver-y fine and a-ble&ndash;&ndash;and handsome
gen-tle-man&ndash;&ndash;a wonderful man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little better. And his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Somers&ndash;&ndash;William the Illustrious&ndash;&ndash;William
the First&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;First in war, first in peace,
and first in the hearts of Gloucestermen&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;and if
you let me stand up, I&rsquo;ll do a break-down to show
you how glad I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re showing something like appreciation.
And now where do you suppose your friend
Clancy is and your skipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clancy? Lord knows. Maybe in a circle of
admiring friends, singing whatever is his latest.
&lsquo;Hove flat down&rsquo; was the last I heard. If it was
earlier in the day&ndash;&ndash;about three in the morning&ndash;&ndash;it
would be pretty sure to be that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity, and he such a fine man otherwise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a pity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, his getting drunk, as I hear he does very
often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gets drunk? Who gets drunk? Clancy?
That&rsquo;s news to me. As long as I&rsquo;ve known him I
never saw him drunk yet. He gets mellow and
loose&ndash;&ndash;but drunk! Clancy drunk? Why, Nell!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, all right, he&rsquo;s an apostle of temperance
then. But Captain Blake&ndash;&ndash;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say&ndash;&ndash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a message for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you try his boarding-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That is, Will did, and he wasn&rsquo;t there,
hadn&rsquo;t been there at all, they said, since the afternoon
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so? Where else did you try? Duncan&rsquo;s
office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did, and no word of him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try Clancy&rsquo;s boarding-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and no word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try&ndash;&ndash;h-m&ndash;&ndash;the Anchorage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joe, you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s been loafing there
since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. And yet after the way he got
turned down yesterday, you know&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s no
telling what a man might do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Will looked in there, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fat little fox! Why didn&rsquo;t you say that at
first? And no word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;d be then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, except&ndash;&ndash;did you notice the wind has
hauled to the northwest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well. Do you know that old vessel that Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
Withrow&rsquo;s been trying to get a crew for&ndash;&ndash;the
Flamingo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-h-h.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this morning early she went out&ndash;&ndash;on a
hand-lining trip to the east&rsquo;ard, it is said. And
Will says that he thinks&ndash;&ndash;he doesn&rsquo;t know, mind
you, because they won&rsquo;t tell him anything down to
Withrow&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;but he thinks that Maurice Blake&rsquo;s
shipped in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! She won&rsquo;t last out one good breeze
on the Banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what Will said. And it&rsquo;s too bad,
for I had a message for him&ndash;&ndash;a message that
would make everything all right. I suppose you
can guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess? H-m-m&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know as I want
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t get mad about it, anyway. How
would you feel if you saw that horrid Minnie
Arkell rush up and&ndash;&ndash;Oh, you know what I mean.
However, I&rsquo;ve been pleading with Alice since yesterday
afternoon. For two hours I was up in her
room last evening, and poor Will walking the
veranda down below. I put Captain Blake&rsquo;s case
as I thought a friend of his would put it&ndash;&ndash;as you
would put it, say&ndash;&ndash;perhaps better in some ways&ndash;&ndash;for
I could not forget that he sailed the Johnnie
Duncan yesterday, and her winning meant so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
to Will. Yes, and I&rsquo;m not forgetting Clancy and
the rest of her crew&ndash;&ndash;indeed, I&rsquo;m not&ndash;&ndash;I felt as
though I could kiss every one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get saucy because your mother is standing
by. Go and find Maurice Blake. Go ahead,
won&rsquo;t you, Joe? Tell him that everything is all
right. She is proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice sounding word for it&ndash;&ndash;pride.
Stuck on herself is what I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t. You must allow a woman self-respect,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. And it must be her long suit, seeing
she&rsquo;s always leading from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, keep your fishermen&rsquo;s jokes for the mugging-up
times on your vessel. You go and get
Maurice Blake&ndash;&ndash;or find Mr. Clancy and have him
get him&ndash;&ndash;if he hasn&rsquo;t gone on the Flamingo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I went out. On a cruise along the water
front I found a whole lot of people. I saw Wesley
Marrs and Tommie Ohlsen&ndash;&ndash;sorrowful and neither
saying much&ndash;&ndash;looking after their vessels&ndash;&ndash;Ohlsen
seeing to a new gaff. &ldquo;I ought to&rsquo;ve lost,&rdquo; said
Ohlsen. &ldquo;Look at that for a rotten piece of wood.&rdquo;
Sam Hollis was around, too, trying to explain how
it was he didn&rsquo;t win the race. But he couldn&rsquo;t explain
to anybody&rsquo;s satisfaction how his stays&rsquo;l went
nor why he hove-to when that squall struck him&ndash;&ndash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
same squall that shot the Johnnie Duncan
across the line. Tom O&rsquo;Donnell was there, looking
down on the deck of the vessel in which he took so
much pride. &ldquo;Two holes in her deck where her
spars ought to be,&rdquo; he was saying when I came
along. I asked him if he had seen Maurice that
morning, and it was from him I learned for certain
that Maurice had shipped on the Flamingo. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t see her leaving, boy, but Withrow himself
told me this morning. &lsquo;And I hope he&rsquo;ll never
come back,&rsquo; he said at the same time. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis you
that takes a licking hard. But maybe &rsquo;tis the insurance,&rsquo;
I says. &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;she isn&rsquo;t insured.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then it must be the
divil&rsquo;s own repair she&rsquo;s in when no company at all
will insure her,&rsquo; I says. Sure, we had hard words
over it, but that won&rsquo;t bring back Maurice&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
gone in the Flamingo, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went after Clancy then, and after a long chase,
that took me to Boston and back, I caught up with
him. He was full of repentance and was gloomy.
It was up in his boarding-house&ndash;&ndash;in his room.
He, looking tired, was thinking of taking a kink
of sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloh, Joe! And I don&rsquo;t wonder you look
surprised, Joe. I must be getting old. Thursday
morning I got up after as fine a night&rsquo;s sleep as a
man&rsquo;d want. That was Thursday. Then Thursday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
night, Friday, Friday night, Saturday&ndash;&ndash;two
nights and three days, and I&rsquo;m sleepy already.
Sleepy, Joe, and I remember the time I could go
a whole week, and then, after a good night&rsquo;s sleep,
wake up fine and daisy and be ready for another
week. Joe, there&rsquo;s a moral in that if you can only
work it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy stayed silent after that, not inclined to
talk, I could see, until I told him about Maurice
having shipped in the Flamingo and the hard crew
that had gone in her.</p>
<p>That stirred him. &ldquo;Great Lord, gone in that
shoe-box! Why, Joe, I&rsquo;d as soon put to sea in a
market basket calked with butter. And the man
that&rsquo;s got her&ndash;&ndash;Dave Warner! He&rsquo;s crazy, Joe,
if ever a man was crazy. Clean out of his head
over a girl that he met in Gloucester once, but now
living in Halifax, and she won&rsquo;t have anything to
do with him. He&rsquo;s daffy over her. If she was
drowning alongside you&rsquo;d curse your luck because
you had to gaff her in. That is, you would only
she&rsquo;s a woman, of course. Wants to get lost, Joe,
I believe&ndash;&ndash;wants to! If this was Boston or New
York and in older days, I&rsquo;d say that Dave and
Withrow must have shanghaied a crew to man the
Flamingo&rsquo;s kind. But you c&rsquo;n get men here to
go in anything sometimes. Wait a bit and I&rsquo;ll be
along with you. We&rsquo;ll see old Duncan and maybe
we c&rsquo;n head the Flamingo off.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XXXVII</h2>
<h3>THE GIRL IN CANSO</h3>
</div>
<p>That was Saturday evening. The crew of
the Johnnie had been told just after the race
by the skipper that he would not need them again
until Monday. Scattering on that, some going to
Boston, they could not be got together again until
Monday morning, and it was not until Monday
noon that we got away.</p>
<p>We fitted out as though for a Cape Shore seining
trip, and that&rsquo;s what we were to do in case we
missed the Flamingo or could not persuade her
skipper or Maurice himself that he ought to leave
her and come back on the Johnnie Duncan. It
was Clancy who had the matter in charge. Indeed,
it was only Clancy who knew what it was really
all about.</p>
<p>We had a good run-off before a stiff westerly
that gradually hauled to the north, and Tuesday
night late saw us in Halifax Harbor. It was too
late to do anything that night, but Clancy went
ashore to find out what he could. Before sunrise
he was back with word to break out the anchor
and put to sea. He had word of the Flamingo.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That girl of Dave&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it seems she&rsquo;s moved to
Canso with her folks, and Dave&rsquo;s gone there. He&rsquo;s
probably there before this&ndash;&ndash;maybe left again.
She&rsquo;s an old plug, the Flamingo, but she ought&rsquo;ve
made Canso before this. He only stayed a few
hours here and left Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was bang, bang, bang all the way to Canso,
with Clancy swearing at Withrow and the Flamingo
and Dave Warner and the girl in the case&ndash;&ndash;one
after the other and sometimes all together.
&ldquo;Blast Withrow and that crazy fool Dave Warner,
too. And why in the devil couldn&rsquo;t her folks
stayed in Gloucester&ndash;&ndash;or in Halifax, at least.
They ought&rsquo;ve put a few sticks of dynamite in her
and blown her to pieces ages ago. She&rsquo;s forty
years old if she&rsquo;s a day&ndash;&ndash;her old planks rotten.
They won&rsquo;t keep her afloat over-night if they&rsquo;re
out in this. Why d&rsquo;y&rsquo;s&rsquo;pose people leave a good
lively little city like Halifax to go to a place like
Canso? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andie Howe happened to be within hearing,
and &ldquo;Maybe the rent&rsquo;s cheaper,&rdquo; suggested Andie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is&ndash;&ndash;and maybe if you don&rsquo;t talk sense
I&rsquo;ll heave you over the rail some fine day. Better
give her a grain more fore-sheet. Man, but it&rsquo;s a
wicked night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made Canso after the worst day and night
we had had in the Johnnie Duncan since she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
launched. Outside Canso Harbor it looked bad.
We didn&rsquo;t think the skipper would try to enter the
harbor that black night, but he did. &ldquo;Got to go
in and get news,&rdquo; said Clancy, and in we went. It
was as black as could be&ndash;&ndash;squalls sweeping down&ndash;&ndash;and
Canso is not the easiest harbor in the world
to make at night.</p>
<p>I went ashore with Clancy to hear what the
young woman might have to say. We found her
in a place run by her father, a sort of lodging house
and &ldquo;pub,&rdquo; with herself serving behind the bar&ndash;&ndash;a
bold-looking young woman, not over-neat&ndash;&ndash;and
yet attractive in her way&ndash;&ndash;good figure, regular
features, and good color. &ldquo;There, Joe, if you
brought a girl like that home your mother would
probably die of a broken heart, but there&rsquo;s the kind
that a foolish man like Dave Warner would sell his
soul for.&rdquo; Then Clancy explained while we were
waiting for her to see us privately, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
if she&rsquo;ll remember me, but I met her two or three
times in Gloucester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she came in she recognized Clancy right
away. &ldquo;How do you do, Captain Clancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Luce? My friend, Mr.
Buckley. Now what we&rsquo;ve come for&ndash;&ndash;but first,
suppose we have a little something by way of sociability.
A little fizzy stuff, say, and some good
cigars, Miss Luce.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>She brought the wine and the cigars. Clancy
pulled the cork, filled both glasses, pushed one
glass toward the young woman and drew one to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Captain, your friend hasn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Clancy, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t drink. The
last thing the doctor said to him before we came
away was, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t touch a drop of liquor or your
life will pay the forfeit.&rsquo; You see, Miss Luce, he&rsquo;s
been a dissipated youth&ndash;&ndash;drink&ndash;&ndash;and having been
dissipated and coming of delicate people, it&rsquo;s affected
his health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me? I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t look
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s a fact. But so it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stomach?&rdquo; she asked me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;heart,&rdquo; answered Clancy for me. &ldquo;What
they call an aneurism. You know what an aneurism
is, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes-yes&ndash;&ndash;oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Well, he&rsquo;s got one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad. So he only smokes instead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. Here, Joe, smoke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, I always thought smoking was bad for the
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is&ndash;&ndash;for everything except aneurisms. Smoking&rsquo;s
the death of aneurisms. Have another cigar,
Joe. And Miss Luce, shall we exchange a health?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But I never drank anything in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. But you will now, won&rsquo;t you?
Consider the occasion and I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t
let me drink alone. And I&rsquo;ve come so far to
see you, too&ndash;&ndash;only of course not&ndash;&ndash;Well, here&rsquo;s
to your good health, and may you live long
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of it was smothered in the gurgle. And
nobody would ever think to see the way she put
down hers that Miss Luce had never had a drink
of wine before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Miss Luce, may I ask how long it
has been since your friend Dave Warner left&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h&ndash;&ndash;Dave Warner? He&rsquo;s no friend of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he? Well, he&rsquo;s no particular friend of
mine, either. But a friend of mine&ndash;&ndash;of both of us,
Joe here, too&ndash;&ndash;is with Dave&ndash;&ndash;Maurice Blake.
Any word of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. A good-looking fellow, nice eyes and
hair and nice manners. I do like to see refined
manners in people. Now if it was him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was him, you wouldn&rsquo;t have told him to
go to sea and the devil take him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you know, Captain Clancy, I don&rsquo;t
swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear? You, Miss Luce? Dear me, whatever
made you think I thought that? But let&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
have another taste of wine. But of course you
didn&rsquo;t encourage Dave to stay ashore here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him?&ndash;&ndash;I guess not. When he said he didn&rsquo;t
care if he never came back, I told him I was sure
I didn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;and out he went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O woman, gentle woman,&rdquo; murmured Clancy
in his glass, &ldquo;especially real ladies. But Dave
never did know how to talk to a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not Dave. And so his money gone
he&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money? Why, he never had any money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s bad. Not even enough to open a
bottle of wine to drink a lady&rsquo;s health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bottle of wine? No, nor a thimbleful of tuppenny
ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was bad, Miss Luce. Dave ought&rsquo;ve
come better heeled&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&lsquo;And so his money gone he puts out to sea&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>It may happen to you or happen to me.&rsquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>And which way did he say he was going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say and I didn&rsquo;t ask, though one of
the men with him said something about going to
the Grand Banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand Banks, eh? That&rsquo;s comforting&ndash;&ndash;it
isn&rsquo;t more than a couple of days&rsquo; sail from here
to the nearest edge of it, and twenty-odd thousand
or more square miles of shoal water to hunt over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
after you get there. Had they taken their bait
aboard, did you hear, Miss Luce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they had. That was yesterday afternoon
late. His vessel was leaking then, I heard him say
to that nice-looking man&ndash;&ndash;Maurice Blake his
name, did you say? A nice name Maurice, isn&rsquo;t
it? Well, he said to Maurice going out the door,
&lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll put out and I callate&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know
how she&rsquo;ll get out but out we&rsquo;ll go to-night.&rsquo; &lsquo;The
sooner you go the better it will suit me,&rsquo; Blake
said, and they went off together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how was Mr. Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean? How did he act? My, I
never saw such a man. Wouldn&rsquo;t open his head
all night&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&rsquo;t drink, but just sat and smoked
like your friend there. Anything the matter with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Maurice? Oh, in the way of aneurisms?
Not that I know of. Oh, yes, he has
heart-trouble too, come to think. But I must be
getting back to the vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve got to go to sea. I&rsquo;m like Dave
Warner in that I&rsquo;m going to sea too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nobody&rsquo;s driving you away.&rdquo; She had her
eyes on Clancy&rsquo;s face then.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t look up&ndash;&ndash;only stared into his glass.</p>
<p>She was silent for a full minute. Clancy said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
nothing. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s driving you away,&rdquo; she said
again.</p>
<p>At that Clancy looked at her. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling,&rdquo;
he said at first, and then hastily, &ldquo;Oh, no&ndash;&ndash;of
course nobody&rsquo;s driving me to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s your hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got up and went to the door then. I heard
the sound of a scraping chair and then of Clancy
standing up. A moment&rsquo;s quiet and then it was:
&ldquo;No, dear, I can&rsquo;t stay&ndash;&ndash;nobody&rsquo;s driving me
away, I know that. I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;not
with your heart. And you&rsquo;ve a good heart if you&rsquo;d
only give it a chance. But I can&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not? You won&rsquo;t, you mean. Well,
I never thought you were <i>that</i> kind of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Well, don&rsquo;t go to giving me any moral
rating. Don&rsquo;t go to over-rating me&ndash;&ndash;or maybe
you&rsquo;d call it under-rating. But you see, it&rsquo;s my
friend that&rsquo;s calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going out in this gale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale. I&rsquo;d go if it was a hundred gales. Good-by&ndash;&ndash;and
take care of yourself, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you come back if you don&rsquo;t find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, Lord, how can I say? Can anybody
say who&rsquo;s coming back and who isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went by me and out the door. She looked
after him, but he never turned&ndash;&ndash;only plunged out
of the house and into the street and I right after
him.</p>

<h2>XXXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE DUNCAN GOES TO THE WEST&rsquo;ARD</h3>
</div>
<p>Getting back to the vessel Clancy was
pretty gloomy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled. We can&rsquo;t
chase them as far to the east&rsquo;ard as the big banks&ndash;&ndash;a
three hundred mile run to the nearest edge of it
and tens of thousands of square miles to hunt over
after we&rsquo;d got there. And it would be child&rsquo;s work
anyway to ask Maurice to leave her on the bank.
Who&rsquo;d take his place even if Dave would stand for
it? &rsquo;Twould mean laying up a dory or taking his
dory-mate too. Maurice wouldn&rsquo;t leave her anyway,
even if he believed he&rsquo;d never get home&ndash;&ndash;no
real fisherman would. And yet there it is&ndash;&ndash;Dave
in a devil of a mood, and a vessel according to all
reports that won&rsquo;t live out one good easterly. And
there&rsquo;s a crazy crew aboard her that won&rsquo;t make
for the most careful handling of a vessel. Oh,
Lord, I don&rsquo;t see anything for it, but, thank the
Lord, Maurice has been behaving himself&ndash;&ndash;and
that in spite of how blue he must have been feeling.
By this time he&rsquo;s cert&rsquo;nly made up his mind he&rsquo;s
with a pretty bad crowd, but maybe he&rsquo;s glad of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
little excitement. What I don&rsquo;t understand is how
Dave ever left old man Luce&rsquo;s place without breaking
up the furniture before going away. Gen&rsquo;rally
that&rsquo;s his style. Maybe Maurice being along had
something to do with it&ndash;&ndash;a pretty able man in close
quarters is Maurice. Yes, he must be glad of the
excitement, but Lord, that won&rsquo;t save him from
being lost. Oh, oh, and now what&rsquo;ll we do? Let&rsquo;s
see, the Flamingo&rsquo;s on the way to the Banks, and
that&rsquo;s the end of that chase. We&rsquo;ve got to wait
now and see that she comes home&ndash;&ndash;or don&rsquo;t come
home&ndash;&ndash;one or the other. I told that girl that I
was going to put out&ndash;&ndash;put out if it blew a hundred
gales. And so I would if any good would come of
it, but putting out to sea a day like this because
you bragged you would&ndash;&ndash;risking your vessel and
crew, or making hard work for them if nothing
else&ndash;&ndash;that ain&rsquo;t good sense, is it? Besides, I had
to tell her something to get away without setting up
to be a model of virtue. What else could I do?
Women are the devil&ndash;&ndash;sometimes&ndash;&ndash;aren&rsquo;t they,
Joe? There&rsquo;s some are. I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t do
any great harm to head her for home. I don&rsquo;t
believe there&rsquo;s going to be much more fish going
to be seined this fall&ndash;&ndash;and wouldn&rsquo;t she make a
passage of it in this easterly? Oh, Lord, it would
be the race all over again, only ten times as long
a drag.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>While he sat there in the cabin, smoking and
meditating, letting us into his thoughts every now
and then, the voices of some of our crew were
heard on deck.</p>
<p>We all went up and got the word that was being
passed around. A coast steamer had just come
to anchor in the harbor with the report that just
outside&ndash;&ndash;about ten miles to the west&rsquo;ard&ndash;&ndash;was a
vessel, dismasted and clean-swept, and dragging
toward the rocks. They could not help her themselves&ndash;&ndash;too
rough&ndash;&ndash;a hurricane outside&ndash;&ndash;to launch
a boat was out of the question. They didn&rsquo;t mind
taking a chance, they said, but to attempt her rescue
would be suicide.</p>
<p>It looked like a pretty hard chance going out in
that gale, but Clancy didn&rsquo;t wait. &ldquo;Nobody else
seems to be hurrying to get out, and we being the
able-est looking craft in the harbor, I callate it&rsquo;s
up to us to go.&rdquo; He got the exact location of the
distressed vessel from the coaster, and then it was
up anchor, make sail, and out we went.</p>
<p>There were people who called Clancy a fool for
ordering out his vessel and risking his crew that
day&ndash;&ndash;men in that very harbor&ndash;&ndash;and maybe he was.
But for myself, I want that kind of a fool for my
skipper. The man that will take a chance for a
stranger will take a bigger chance for his own by
and by.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>We saw her while we were yet miles away,
down to the west&rsquo;ard&ndash;&ndash;near Whitehead and with
the cruel stretch of rocks under her lee quarter.
Even with plenty of sea-room she could not have
lasted long, and here with these ledges to catch
her she looked to be in for a short shrift. We had
a good chance to get a look at her as we bore
down. Everything was gone from her deck, even
the house and rail. There was not as much loose
wood on deck as would make a tooth-pick. Afterwards
we learned that two seas hove her down so
that they had to cut the spars away to right her,
and then just as she was coming up another monster
had caught her and swept her clean&ndash;&ndash;not only
swept clean, but stove in her planks and started
some of her beams so that she began to leak in a
fashion that four men to the pumps could just
manage to keep up with.</p>
<p>We could just see them&ndash;&ndash;the men to the pumps
working desperately&ndash;&ndash;with the others lashed to the
stumps of the masts and the stanchions which were
left when the rail went. Her big hawser had
parted and her chain was only serving to slightly
check her way toward the rocks.</p>
<p>With spars and deck gear gone and her hull
deep in the water, a vessel is not so easily distinguished.
But there was something familiar in this
one. We had seen her before. All at once it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
flashed on half a dozen of us&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the Flamingo!&rdquo;
we said. &ldquo;God! that&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>She lay in a sort of inlet that was wide open to
the gale, rocks on the better part of three sides
of her, north, south and west. She was then within
all but striking distance of the rocks, and the seas,
high and wicked, were sweeping over her. It
looked like a bad place to work out of if we should
get close in, but Clancy held on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much lee-room, but plenty of water under
her keel anyway,&rdquo; and himself to the wheel, sailed
the Johnnie around the Flamingo. He hailed
Maurice as he went by, waved his hand to the
others, and hove a line aboard. They took the
line, hauled in the hawser at the end of it, made
that fast to the windlass, and then we started off
with her in tow.</p>
<p>We were doing pretty well, what with plenty of
wind and the Johnnie buckling down to her work
like she was a steamer, till the hawser parted and
back toward the rocks went the Flamingo again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; said Clancy, &ldquo;sea&rsquo;s too much for any
line we got. We&rsquo;ll try it with the seine-boat.
Who&rsquo;ll go in the seine-boat and try to take them
off? Think quick, but mind what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every man of the crew of the Johnnie Duncan
said, &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; The cook even came out of the
forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le and put in his &ldquo;And me, too, skipper.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good men,&rdquo; said Clancy,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;damn good
men,&rdquo; and looked us up and down. We felt proud,
he said it in such a way. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re taking your
lives in your hands and some of you got wives and
children&ndash;&ndash;mothers or something. Who hasn&rsquo;t
anybody depending on him? Which of you hasn&rsquo;t
any woman somewhere, or little brothers or
sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>About twelve of the sixteen men standing on the
deck of the Johnnie Duncan said &ldquo;Me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-quarters of you, at least,&rdquo; said Clancy,
&ldquo;are damn liars. Over with the seine-boat and be
careful nobody gets hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somebody did get hurt, though. Andie Howe
got his foot smashed and was helped below.
Clancy gave the rest of us a scolding in advance.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt yet, but some of you will be&ndash;&ndash;like
Andie&ndash;&ndash;if you don&rsquo;t watch out. You&rsquo;d think
that some of you were out on some little pond up
in the country somewhere launching a canoe off
one of those club-house floats. Keep an eye out
for those seas when they board. And watch out
for that deckload or some of you&rsquo;ll have a head
cut off. A man killed or a man washed over the
rail&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s the difference&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a man lost. Look
out now&ndash;&ndash;watch, you Steve&ndash;&ndash;damn you, watch
out! Over with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And over it went and with it leaped two men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
before it could sag away, while the rest of us stood
by the rail watching our chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo; called Clancy, &ldquo;come away from that
rail! Steve, come away!&ndash;&ndash;come away, I say, and
no back talk. Pat, you can go&ndash;&ndash;jump in&ndash;&ndash;watch
your chance or it&rsquo;s the last of you. Eddie, you can
go, and you Bill, and you Frenchy. Joe! stand
away from that rail or I&rsquo;ll put you in the hold and
batten the hatches on you. Now, that&rsquo;s better.
And that&rsquo;s enough&ndash;&ndash;six men to the oars and one
to steer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;ll steer?&rdquo; asked somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know in a minute,&rdquo; said Clancy, and
he leaped for the seine-boat and made it, and
grabbed the steering oar. &ldquo;Stand by&ndash;&ndash;push off!
Fend off in the vessel there! Steve, if anything
happens&ndash;&ndash;you know&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re to take the Johnnie
home. Give way, fellows. Now! Watch out!&ndash;&ndash;now&ndash;&ndash;now
then, around with her&ndash;&ndash;end on,
and there she is like a bird! And now drive
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bird!&rdquo; said Clancy&ndash;&ndash;but a wild-looking
bird&ndash;&ndash;fifty feet she looked to be going into the
air one moment and down out of sight the next,
and water slamming aboard her so that we thought
she was swamped half a dozen times. Two had
to leave the oars and go to bailing, while Clancy
with an arm and shoulders and back and swinging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
waist like&ndash;&ndash;well, like nothing a man ever had before&ndash;&ndash;kept
her end to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; we called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll bring &rsquo;em back!&rdquo; said
Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or stay with them,&rdquo; we thought.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t stay with them. It was a ticklish
job, but Clancy got away with it. He didn&rsquo;t dare
to go too near the Flamingo, for that meant that
the seas would pitch the seine-boat up and dash it
to kindling wood against her hull. What he did
do was to go as near the Flamingo as he could and
keep her clear, then heave a line aboard and call to
her crew one after the other to make it fast around
themselves and jump overboard. It took some
nerve to make that jump&ndash;&ndash;from the rigging of
the Duncan we watched them&ndash;&ndash;saw them shiver
and draw up&ndash;&ndash;these were men accustomed to face
danger&ndash;&ndash;reckless men&ndash;&ndash;but the shiver was over
in a breath, and then over the rail and into that
sea&ndash;&ndash;a game fight&ndash;&ndash;and they were hauled into the
seine-boat. Some of them we thought would never
make it, for it was an awful sea.</p>
<p>As fast as one of the Flamingo&rsquo;s men made the
seine-boat he was set to work bailing out or taking
a haul at the oars, for it was a difficult matter in
that sea to keep the seine-boat at the right distance
from the Flamingo. But they got them all&ndash;&ndash;ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
of them. Two were hauled in unconscious, but
came to after awhile.</p>
<p>To get aboard the Johnnie again was almost as
bad as to get into the seine-boat from the Flamingo.
But we managed it. Long Steve was swept over
while we were at it, but we got him back with the
help of Maurice Blake and another of the Flamingo&rsquo;s
crowd. By smart clever work they
grabbed Steve before he could go down and
hauled him into the seine-boat.</p>
<p>When they were all safe aboard the Duncan
Clancy shook hands with Maurice. &ldquo;I call that
luck, Maurice&ndash;&ndash;to come out to save a stranger and
find you&rsquo;ve saved your own. And now whose trick
to the wheel&ndash;&ndash;you, Joe? Put her on the off-shore
tack till we&rsquo;re well clear of that headland&ndash;&ndash;maybe
we c&rsquo;n make it in one leg. No? Then a short
tack and have an eye out for the ledges&ndash;&ndash;not too
close. And Maurice, go below&ndash;&ndash;you and Dave
and all hands of you, and we&rsquo;ll get out dry clothes
for you. Man, but you must be cold and hungry,
but the cook&rsquo;s getting coffee and grub ready. And
for the Duncan&rsquo;s crew&ndash;&ndash;on deck all hands and put
the tops&rsquo;ls to her. For, Maurice-boy, we&rsquo;re going
home&ndash;&ndash;going home, Maurice&ndash;&ndash;where there&rsquo;s people
waiting for you. Hang on a while longer,
Joe, and I&rsquo;ll take her myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No need to tell me to hang on. If I hadn&rsquo;t hung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
on or been lashed to the wheel I could never have
kept my feet, for at this time it was so bad that
they had passed a line from my waist to the
windward bitt and I was up to my waist with every
dive of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, she&rsquo;s a dog, ain&rsquo;t she! If old man Duncan
could see her now! Remember Tom O&rsquo;Donnell
singing that song the other night:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&lsquo;West half-no&rsquo;the and drive her&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;re abreast now of Cape Sable&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>&rsquo;Tis an everlasting hurricane, but here&rsquo;s the craft that&rsquo;s able.&rsquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>We&rsquo;re not abreast of Cape Sable yet, but it won&rsquo;t
take us too many hours at this clip. And here&rsquo;s the
craft that&rsquo;s able. Man, wouldn&rsquo;t it be fine if Tom
O&rsquo;Donnell himself was with us and the pair of us
racing home? Let me take the wheel, Joe. And
go for&rsquo;ard and have a mug-up for yourself&ndash;&ndash;and
have a care going, Joe, for it&rsquo;s leaping she is now
and seas that&rsquo;d lift you a cable&rsquo;s length to looard
if ever they caught you fair. That&rsquo;s it&ndash;&ndash;oh, but
if your mother could see you now, Joe, it&rsquo;s never
to sea you&rsquo;d come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made my way for&rsquo;ard. A dash between the
house and windward rail, a shoot for the mainmast
and holding on there for awhile. Another dive
for the gripes on the dories, another shoot between
rail and dories, a grip of the bow gripes, a swing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
around and I was at the forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le hatch. Here I
thought I heard him call and looked aft.</p>
<p>He had a leg either side of the wheel, standing
full height and sawing the spokes a bit up and
down to get the feel of her. The life line was
trailing from his waist to the bitt&ndash;&ndash;the clear white
sea was up to his middle and racing over the taffrail.
He had cast away his mitts the better to grip
the spokes, and even as I looked he took off his
sou&rsquo;wester and sent it scaling. The wind taking
hold of it must have carried it a quarter a mile to
leeward. Watching it go, himself looking out
under the boom, he laughed&ndash;&ndash;laughed&ndash;&ndash;such a
roar of a laugh&ndash;&ndash;stamped his feet and began to
sing:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I love old Ocean&rsquo;s smile,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>I love old Ocean&rsquo;s frowning&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>My love&rsquo;s for Ocean all the while,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>My prayer&rsquo;s for death by drowning.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The devil was in him then. &ldquo;Did you call me,
skipper?&rdquo; I sang out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? Did I? Lord, Joe, I don&rsquo;t know.
Maybe I did. I feel like calling from here to
Gloucester, and if I did I bet they&rsquo;d hear me.
God, Joe, but it&rsquo;s good to be alive, isn&rsquo;t it?&ndash;&ndash;just
to be alive. Whew! but I wish I had a few more
sou&rsquo;westers&ndash;&ndash;just to see &rsquo;em scale. But what was
it I wanted&ndash;&ndash;but is the cook there?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He is&ndash;&ndash;I c&rsquo;n hear him talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go below and tell him, Joe&ndash;&ndash;tell him to
mouse his pots and kettles, for with sail alow and
sail aloft, with her helmsman lashed and her house
awash, in a living gale and the devil&rsquo;s own sea,
the Johnnie Duncan&rsquo;s going to the west&rsquo;ard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she certainly went.</p>

<h2>XXXIX</h2>
<h3>THE HEART OF CLANCY</h3>
</div>
<p>That trip ended seining for the Duncan that
year. Everything went well with our
friends, after we got home. It was late in the
season, and Maurice Blake was to stay ashore to
get married, for one thing. He had made a great
season of it and could afford to. So the Johnnie
Duncan was fitted out for fresh halibuting and
Clancy took her.</p>
<p>I went with him. I remember very well that I
had no idea of going winter fishing when the
seining season ended, but, somehow or other when
Clancy came to get a crew together I was looking
for a chance.</p>
<p>So we put out, and on the rocks of Cape Ann,
near Eastern Point lighthouse, on the day we sailed
on our first halibuting trip, were Maurice Blake
and Alice Foster, my cousin Nell and Will Somers,
to wave us good luck. Clancy hauled the vessel
close in to get a better look and they waved us until
I suppose they could see us no longer. Of course
they should have been able to make us out long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
after we had lost sight of them, we being a tall-sparred,
white-sailed vessel; and Clancy must have
had that in mind, for long after all signs of them
had been lost to us he kept the glasses pointed to
the rocks. He turned at last with a &ldquo;Well, I suppose
they&rsquo;re all happy now, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they ought to be,&rdquo; he repeated, and then
again, &ldquo;they ought to be,&rdquo; and went for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>He stayed for&rsquo;ard a long time, saying no word,
but leaning over the windlass and looking out
ahead. Nobody disturbed him. Once or twice
when the sheets needed trimming&ndash;&ndash;and in a deep
sleep I think Clancy would know that&ndash;&ndash;he turned
and gave the word, but the bare word and no more.
He had his spells we all knew, when he didn&rsquo;t want
anybody near him, and so he wanted to be alone,
I suppose. And there he stayed, with what spray
came over the bow splashing him, but he paying
no attention.</p>
<p>At supper call he moved, but not to go below and
eat&ndash;&ndash;only to shift to walking the quarter, and
walking the quarter he stayed until near midnight.
He went below then after giving a few words of
instruction to the watch&ndash;&ndash;went below and got out
his pipe. From my bunk, the middle port bunk in
the cabin, I watched him rummaging for tobacco
in his stateroom and then his coming out with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
pipe and his filling and lighting it slowly and
thoughtfully, and then his sitting and smoking under
the cabin lamp.</p>
<p>Looking over when he had finished that pipeful&ndash;&ndash;I
had not drawn my curtain&ndash;&ndash;he caught my
eyes on him. He smiled, but said nothing&ndash;&ndash;only
lit another pipeful, and kept on smoking.</p>
<p>I fell asleep watching him&ndash;&ndash;fell asleep and woke
again. He must have been watching me, for his
eyes were on mine when I looked for him again.
He smiled and shook his pipe out, and made as
though to turn in.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t turn in. He took off his jersey,
loosened the collar of his flannel shirt, cast off his
slip-shods&ndash;&ndash;stopped&ndash;&ndash;looked into his bunk, came
back, filled and lit another pipeful and began to
talk to me. I thought I was sleepy, but in five
minutes I didn&rsquo;t think so. Joking, laughing, telling
stories&ndash;&ndash;in ten minutes he had me roaring. Before
long he had everybody in the cabin awake and
roaring, too. Men, coming off watch and into the
cabin to warm up, or for one thing or another, listened
and stayed. He kept that up all the rest of
the night&ndash;&ndash;until after six o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
and only the cook called to breakfast there&rsquo;s no
telling when he would have stopped. And not
until he was going for&rsquo;ard to eat did I get a glimpse
of what it was he had been thinking of during all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
those earlier hours of the night. The sun, I remember,
was streaking the sky ahead of us&ndash;&ndash;he
stopped just as he was about to drop into the
forec&rsquo;s&rsquo;le and pointed it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sunrise, Joe, on a fine October morning out
to sea&ndash;&ndash;beautiful&ndash;&ndash;beautiful&ndash;&ndash;but just one thing
wrong about it. And what is it?&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t see?
Well, Joe, it&rsquo;s over the bow. A sunrise, Joe, is
most beautiful when it&rsquo;s over the stern&ndash;&ndash;and why?
&rsquo;Cause then you&rsquo;re going home&ndash;&ndash;of course. Going
home, Joe&ndash;&ndash;if you&rsquo;ve got a home to go to. Look
to it, Joe, that you&rsquo;ve got a home of your own to
go to before you&rsquo;re much older. Somebody to
work for&ndash;&ndash;somebody waiting for you&ndash;&ndash;a wife,
Joe&ndash;&ndash;wife and children&ndash;&ndash;or you&rsquo;re in for some
awful lonesome times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Clancy&ndash;&ndash;watch-mate, bunk-mate,
dory-mate once, and now my skipper&ndash;&ndash;Clancy,
who could be any man&rsquo;s friend, the man that everybody
jumped to shake hands with, and yet never a
bit of use to himself. And I couldn&rsquo;t but half
wonder at that, and kept my eyes on him when,
with one foot on the top step of the companionway,
he turned and looked around again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you can&rsquo;t get anybody, skipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s hard&ndash;&ndash;though most likely you&rsquo;ve deserved
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t deserved it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Deserved it? Yes, and ten times over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rough? No, it&rsquo;s right. When you do wrong
you&rsquo;ve got to make up for it. It&rsquo;s all in the big
scheme of the universe. You&rsquo;ve got to strike a
balance some time&ndash;&ndash;somewhere. And the sooner
the better. Be thankful if you have to settle it
right away, Joe. If you don&rsquo;t and it drags along&ndash;&ndash;then
it&rsquo;s worse again, and the Lord help those
that come after you&ndash;&ndash;those that have to take up
life where you&rsquo;ve left it off. The Lord have
mercy on the heirs of your brain and heart and
soul, boy. What you hand them they&rsquo;ve got to
take. Yes, sir, you&rsquo;ll pay for it somewhere&ndash;&ndash;you
yourself, or, what&rsquo;s worse, those you care for will
have to pay&ndash;&ndash;in this world or another&ndash;&ndash;whatever
it is we&rsquo;re coming to, a better or a worse world,
it&rsquo;s there and waiting us. Be thankful, as I said,
Joe, if you have to settle for it here&ndash;&ndash;settle for it
yourself alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All around, above and below, ahead and astern,
he looked, a long, long look astern&ndash;&ndash;his foot on
the step, and singing softly, almost to himself:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;And if I come to you, my love,</p>
<p><span class='indent3'>&nbsp;</span>And my heart free from guile,</p>
<p><span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Will you have a glance for me&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p><span class='indent3'>&nbsp;</span>Will you on me smile?</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>Oh, Lord! pipe-dreams&ndash;&ndash;pipe-dreams. Let&rsquo;s go
below, Joe, and have a bite to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So below we went; and her sails lit up by the
morning sun, her decks wet by the slapping sea,
sheets off and sailing free, the Johnnie Duncan
clipped her way to the east&rsquo;ard.</p>
